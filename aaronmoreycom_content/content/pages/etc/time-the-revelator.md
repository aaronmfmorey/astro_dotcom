# Time (The Revelator) 
I've been informally tracking musical references on the Gillian Welch album _Time (The Revelator)_ for a long time, under the assumption that if they're into something, it's a rabbit hole I would enjoy getting lost in too. Something like this probably already exists on the internet, everything exists on the internet. Just don't tell me. It's something that I wanna hear, I'm gonna sing it myself.

## 1\. Revelator

- _She caught the Katy / Left me a mule to ride_ is a direct quote from the blues song _She Caught The Katy_ ([Taj Mahal](https://youtu.be/8_mcvifJ5N0))

## 2\. My First Lover

 - _Quicksilver girl / And she's free_ They give you this one for free. It's [that old Steve Miller song.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VFw_sCVR5VM)

## 3\. Dear Someone

## 4\. Red Clay Halo

## 5\. April the 14th Part 1

- _God moves on the water_ a [blues song](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Moves_on_the_Water) about the sinking of the Titanic ([A recording](https://youtu.be/zlZ3QQVSLPI))

- _With the sails in ragsâ€¦ with the staggers and the jags_: Stan Rogers's [Barrett's Privateers](https://youtu.be/mQbh7UNCZdc)

## 6\. I Want To Sing That Rock and Roll

- Compare _I want to reach that glory land/ I want to shake my Savior's hand_ with _I want to wear a crown of glory / When I get home to that bright land / I want to shout Salvation's story / In concert with that bloodwashed band. / I'm going there to meet my Saviour_ from [I Am A Poor Wayfaring Stranger](https://www.bluegrassnet.com/lyrics/i-am-a-poor-wayfaring-stranger)

## 7\. Elvis Presley Blues

- _Thinking how happy John Henry was when he fell down and died_: A reference to [The Ballad of John Henry](http://folklore.usc.edu/the-ballad-of-john-henry/)

- _Shook it like a midnight rambler_ is surely a reference to the [Rolling Stomes song](https://youtu.be/TUGOKB-JOT8?feature=shared), though exactly what it has to do with Elvis shaking his hips escapes me.

## 8\. Ruination Day Part 2

- _It was not December / And it was not in May / It was the fourteenth of April, that is ruination day / That's the day... / The day that is ruination day_: Maybe this is a stretch, but I think they're riffing on the gospel song _[Last Month of the Year](https://youtu.be/H2RZ9pzV2FM)_: "Was it January (No no), February (No no) / March April or May / June, August, September, October, November / The twenty-fifth day of December / The last month of the year"

## 9\. Everything is Free

- _If there's something that you wanna hear / You can sing it yourself_: see [Froggie Went A-Courtin'](https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/froggie-went-courtin/) "A little piece of cornbread layin' on a shelf / If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, Uh-huh" ([Dylan's version](https://youtu.be/47NFLztId4E))

## 10\. I Dream a Highway

- More [staggers and jags](https://youtu.be/mQbh7UNCZdc)

- _Lord let me die with a hammer in my hand_: More John Henry references and, I would argue, the thesis statement of the album. An assertion of the artist's work as fundamentally human, in the face of technological progress and changing trends. See also, Everything Is Free.
