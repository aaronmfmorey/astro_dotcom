You were young (Google suggests not more than two weeks old) and you didn't know much of the world, even by the standards of the rabbit mind. But you knew some good things: your mom's fur, the satisfaction of a belly full of milk, the wiggling of your brothers and sisters next to you.

You also knew suffering. The terror of a force beyond your control or comprehension carrying you away. The loneliness and fear of solitude, the quiet in the last moments as your body stopped fighting to hold onto life.

We're not so different in that way. In your few days of life, you experienced the first and last things of every living creature's fate. But because you didn't (couldn't!) sin, you will suffer no more. Our souls are different from yours, but may God give us the grace to live free of sin and enter into the peace our souls were made for.

> He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away
