Breaking with my normal habit for no particular reason, I reviewed _Measure For Measure_ on Goodreads instead of here. I reproduce the review here for posterity:

> This book provides something I've always wanted but never found written before: a brief (very brief, a page and a half at most) description of various poetic meters and then a bunch of examples. Looking at a stress/unstress pattern chart is all well and good for an initial introduction to a poem. But (at least for me, a learn-by-doing minded person), the FEEL of the pattern only becomes clear when you've read a dozen poems in that meter and your internal monologue starts slipping into it.
> 
> I, for example, never got hendecasyllables until I read this collection. When you encounter one example among a collection of poetry, it feels like a mistake. Like a misstep in the rhythm, or a lesser poem that the poet couldn't quite get right. But when you've read 5-10 of them in a row, you can sense the stutter step in the middle that the writer is creating intentionally.
> 
> If you're already quite adept at reading poetry this is probably all very basic, but if you're a beginner it really drives itself home.
