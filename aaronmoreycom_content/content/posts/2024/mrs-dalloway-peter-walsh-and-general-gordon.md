As he walks through London, Peter Walsh finds himself "standing under Gordon’s statue, Gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped; Gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed,—poor Gordon, he thought."

As an American who doesn't know that much 19th century British history, I nearly let that comment pass. But I was curious so I looked him up. Having perused the wikipedia article, I'm happy to announce I am now an expert on his life.

I think Gordon is the key to understanding Peter's personality. Gordon was a grandly ambitious idealist, like Peter. Gordon spent much of his career in the East, as Europeans as the time would have thought of it: China, Egypt, Sudan. After a series of military victories, he was killed defending his headquarters in Khartoum from the mahdi's forces.

Peter is also obsessed with the eastern edges of the Empire, having been in India and (seemingly) what is now Tibet or Nepal. He's fallen in love with at least two Indian women. But unlike Gordon he hasn't achieved any acclaim. At 51, Gordon was firing his last shots before dying in battle. Peter, at 51, is back in London without a job or anything in particular to do. He's probably envying Gordon's fate.
