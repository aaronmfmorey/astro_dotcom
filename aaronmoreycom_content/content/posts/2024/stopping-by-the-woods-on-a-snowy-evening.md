Am I reading my own inner Distributist into Frost here, or is there an implicit criticism of the owner of the woods?

(I'm calling the viewpoint character Robert Frost, yes, persona, etc., but I've got to call him something)

"Whose woods these are I _think_ I know / His _house_ is in the village _though_"

The stresses line up on "think", "house" and "though" in a way that isn't strictly necessary in normal speech. You could emphasize other syllables and change the connotation of the sentence. Frost, someone who apparently travels this route enough that his horse knows the stops by heart, only _thinks_ he knows the owner of these woods. He doesn't often see him around caring for the trees or admiring the view. If he'd followed with "_His_ house _is_ in the village though", it might imply "He's not here now but he's nearby". But as the stresses line up it seems to say "He lives way over there, apart from the presence of the trees, only an owner in an economic sense."

"He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow."

He's so distant from the woods, he won't even notice that Frost has stopped to admire them, and isn't seeing for himself how beautiful they are. He's missing the relationship to the land that Frost wants to have. But his private ownership even prevents Frost from enjoying it as he should. Frost can only stop "by" the woods. He's standing "_Between_ the woods and frozen lake", not willing or able to enter what isn't a public area.

"The woods are lovely, dark and deep _/ but_…"

Frost can't stop either. If it were his own land, he'd be home already and could go for a walk within. But he can't trespass on someone else's land, and anyway he's got his own business to attend to: "and miles to go before I sleep."
