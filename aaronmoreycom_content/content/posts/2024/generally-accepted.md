Something interesting I just noticed on Wikipedia (let me stop you right there, yes, I know, but if I didn't post comments about something I found in Wikipedia, I'd barely post here at all): Robert Frost, born 1874, has the middle name Lee.

He was born in San Francisco to New Englanders, it seems unlikely they were Confederate sympathizers. Less than a decade after the war, was "Robert Lee" not something of an off-limits name? Were they intending to name him for the general, or was it an unintentional coincidence?
