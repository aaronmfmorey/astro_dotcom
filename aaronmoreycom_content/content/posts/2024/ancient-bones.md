In Robert Frost's _Steeple Bush_ there are two poems about stumbling upon the long-undisturbed home of an ancient native person; "To An Ancient" and "A Cliff Dwelling." The second, in particular is an almost exact description of the scene from Gene Wolfe's _Peace_ where Weir and Aunt Olivia visit an ancient cave dwelling with her professor boyfriend.

What does it mean? I don't know.
