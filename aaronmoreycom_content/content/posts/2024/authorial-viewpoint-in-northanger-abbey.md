Bear in mind, I'm only 5 chapters in, but it seems like Austen is breaking with her usual style of telling the story mostly through the viewpoint of her main character. She has a number of authorial asides already, most notably her defense of the reading of novels within novels:

> Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves addingâ€”joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us not desert one another; we are an injured body. \[_ed. This goes on quite a bit longer but you have to gist_\]

Above I said "breaking with her usual style" but it's also possible she hasn't yet developed her usual style. Although one of the last published, _Northanger Abbey_ was one of her earlier-written novels. She apologizes in the preface for the length of time between writing and publication, and the changes of style in the intervening years.

I can't recall any scene from _Emma_, _Persuasion_ or _Mansfield Park_ that takes place outside the main character's presence. The whole viewpoint of the novel is mediated through the heroine's point of view. I wasn't tracking this point-of-view question closely before that, so I'm not sure about _Pride and Prejudice_ or _Sense and Sensibility_. Perhaps it was a development with her later novels. The limited viewpoint character allows a degree of irony that Austen seemed to enjoy (particularly in _Emma_) where she could keep not only the characters but the reader in the dark about other characters' intentions.

**Update:** I just thought of at least one scene from _Mansfield Park_ that Fanny isn't present for as the reader's surrogate: the conversation where Mr. Crawford tells his sister his scheme to make Fanny fall in love with him. Note how explicit that is, in comparison to Frank Churchill's sly double-entendres in _Emma_.
