For example, today I learned from an untitled 1937 Robert Frost poem that Abercrombie and Fitch did not get their start as an edgy early 1990s mall-fashion store.

*Untitled, possibly unpublished(?), poem by Robert Frost. First line: "Dear Leonard Bacon:"*

It was apparently a rugged outdoor gear shop in its early days.

_Edit: A darkly absurd detail I just noticed on Wikipedia is that Hemingway shot himself with a gun from Abercrombie and Fitch_.
