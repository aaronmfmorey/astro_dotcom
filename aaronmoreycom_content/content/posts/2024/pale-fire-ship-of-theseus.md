In this article from [Noted](https://jillianhess.substack.com/p/renoted-marginalia-5-ways-to-write), I was reminded of _S._, a novel-ish piece of media I read a number of years ago. It was mostly forgettable, or at least I barely remember it. But I had flashbacks when I started _Pale Fire_ recently.

The books are almost mirror opposites: _PF_ an inward-looking personal poem in the commentary of which deposed royalty\* reacts to the socialist revolution in his country. _S._ on the other hand is a story of revolution from the viewpoint of the revolutionaries, around which a personal relationship forms in the marginalia. Surely the authors of _S_. (One of whom is better known for creating the puzzle box TV series _Lost_ than this puzzle box novel), were inspired by _PF_. It almost makes me want to revisit _S._ and see.

_The link to Noted came from the excellent literary roundup newsletter [Washington Review of Books](https://open.substack.com/pub/thewashingtonreviewofbooks/p/wrbmar-30-2024?r=2dxjx&utm_medium=ios)._
