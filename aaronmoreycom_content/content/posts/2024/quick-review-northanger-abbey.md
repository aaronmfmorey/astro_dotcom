I don't have a whole lot to say. It didn't leave me with much impression. It was competent; great prose as you'd expect from Jane Austen, but less substantial in the character building. The villain is obvious practically from the moment he appears on the scene. His constant malfeasance takes the drama out of later scenes when the reader has no choice but to think "obviously this misunderstanding is because he lied."

It's clear she hadn't yet developed her mature style, [but I've been](/posts/2024/authorial-viewpoint-in-northanger-abbey/) 
[over that already](/posts/2024/speaking-of-style-and-northanger-abbey/).

I have to say I laughed aloud at this note on the final page of the book:

> Concerning the \[gentleman Miss Tilney marries\], therefore, I have only to add — aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable — that this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of her most alarming adventures.

Say what else you want, her wit was always there.
