One of my goofier literary theories is my half-belief that Taylor Swift is riffing on Eliot's _The Journey of the Magi_ in Tis The Damn Season.

There are a few reasons I think this, but what first put it in my head was the finality of the way she says "write this down." It sounds, to me at least, exactly the way I read "but set down / this set down / this", with the hard, insistent emphasis on each word. Those lines are the turn both of the poem and the chorus of the song. Notice how she follows it up quickly with a "road not taken" reference. She's planting the seed in the listener's head: remember those poems we all read in high school?

Having noted that, the close listener will recognize that the themes are the same: a long journey that starts out in bitter cold brings the viewpoint character to the warmth of a long-anticipated boy. But on arrival, they recognize there is no easy, lasting comfort in his presence and the return to the old way of life will only be sadder for having had the experience. What are those "so-called friends who'll write books about me" when she "go\[es\] back to LA" ("we returned to our places, these Kingdoms") if not "the alien people clutching their gods" in the "old dispensation"?

**Later edit**: I should add I was inspired to type these thoughts out by this lengthy Substack article that points out a lyrical allusion to The Albatross (another entry in the "I vaguely remember that from high school English" canon)

> Other times it emerges in recurring tendencies, as in The Albatross. \[...\] For most of the song, she plays the idiomatically famous literary allusion of the title fairly straight, if not quite in a manner that proves she has ever read Coleridge
