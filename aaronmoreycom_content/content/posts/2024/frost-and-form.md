The [Poems Ancient and Modern](https://open.substack.com/pub/poemsancientandmodern/p/todays-poem-for-once-then-something?r=2dxjx&utm_medium=ios) substack had a good post that put into words something I have vaguely thought but not been able to express exactly.

> The unrhymed lines \[of Robert Frost's "For Once, Then, Something"\] are in hendecasyllabics, the Greek and Latin line of eleven syllables, traditionally consisting of a trochee or spondee, a choriamb, and two iambs. Here the meter scans as a trochee, a dactyl, and three more trochees. It’s absolutely consistent throughout, with no shifts, substitutions, or hiccups of any kind: a perfect surface, like the well water.  
> 
> Yet the diction is so natural, conversational, and unforced, that in no place does this metrical achievement call attention to itself. Nothing seems done for the sake of the meter. No word strains to fit. It’s hard to think of any American contemporary of Frost’s who could have, or would have, accomplished this feat of both form and meaning.
