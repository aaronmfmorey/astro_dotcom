Something interesting happens in the whale butchering sequence of _Moby Dick_. Melville creates a very strange metaphor, speaking about the biology of the whale's head:

> What a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.
> 
> &mdash; _Moby Dick, Ch. 74_

Then just a few pages later, Tashtego falls into the whale's head while butchering it. Melville not at all subtly relates his being freed from the head to a childbirth. Tashtego is born again, pulled from the water. Real baptismal, pentecostal imagery! Surely this portends something. Will he become a wild prophet, like we've seen with Elijah and Gabriel? Will be become a figure of wisdom like Athena, born from being cut from her father's head?

Hopefully I'll be able to come back to this with an answer later.
