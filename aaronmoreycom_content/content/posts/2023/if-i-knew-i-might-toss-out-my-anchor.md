Following Jimmy Buffett's death on Friday, I was surprised by the way he was eulogized. I had expected contrarian takes about him as the mouthpiece of anhedonic Boomer excess, the colonialism inherent in the island lifestyle he protrayed, his protagonist's seemingly endless supply of interchangeable bikini-clad women. Instead he was mostly lauded as a wholesome (or maybe just a bit naughty) purveyor of good times.

The latter is, if anything, less respectful in the way it glosses over his oeuvre's complexities. For every straightforwardly fun song like Cheeseburger in Paradise or Boat Drinks, there are half a dozen where the viewpoint character is a scumbag or a loser (with varying degrees of remorse or even recognition of their scoundrel status).

In Margaritaville, at least, the protagonist comes around to the acknowledement that "it's my own damn fault."

Jimmy Buffet could see that the Florida Keys of vacationers' imaginations is essentially fake: no one who's listened to Buffett intently was surprised by the recent Sam Kriss article about [The Villages](https://thelampmagazine.com/issues/issue-17/shadow-on-the-sun). "Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes" implies a two way street. The relaxed way of life you find on a cruise won't survive contact with the rest of life. He was savvy enough, and spent enough time among vacationing accountants and roofers, to understand that the paradise life that we aspire to to can only be a brief respite from the real world and it evaporates or sours when we try to sustain it indefinitely.
