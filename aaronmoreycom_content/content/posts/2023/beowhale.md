Several times throughout the first few chapters of _Moby Dick_, Melville goes off on an extended sentence or paragraph of assonant lists. I grabbed a couple that jumped out at me from Chapter 5:

> The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.

> Moby Dick, Chapter 5

> Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!

> Moby Dick, Chapter 5

This reads like Middle English epic poetry. _Beowulf_, or _Gawain and the Green Knight_ are full of this kind of thing. I wonder how much of this was just Melville being playful, and how much he was consciously positioning his novel in the tradition of English epics?
