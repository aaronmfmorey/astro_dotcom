I'm reading _La Morte D'Arthur_ for the first time and, just a few dozen pages in, it's not what _The Once and Future King_ or even _The Boys King Arthur_ give you.

Right on page one, King Uther Pendragon tries to seduce a Duke's wife. She refuses him, so he goes to war with the Duke. The Duke is killed in battle. Meanwhile Merlin disguises King Uther as the dead Duke so he can sleep with the wife. Arthur is conceived and the duke's wife agrees to marry King Uther (she does not at this point realize who the father of her child is).

One thing leads to another, and a bunch of kings are angry — sorry, _wroth_ — that they have to be ruled over by a boy with no royal blood. Merlin goes to them to explain that Arthur actually is the son of the late king. "Is he a bastard?" they want to know. No, Merlin explains, Arthur was conceived a full three hours after the Duke died. The other kings find this explanation satisfactory and agree not to oppose Arthur.

What a wild ride! And I'm only 6% off the way through the first of two volumes.
