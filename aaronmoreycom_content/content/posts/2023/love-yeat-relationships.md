I've started reading a Yeats collection and I have to say in not digging it. I'm only a dozen or so poems in, so maybe it's arranged chronologically and he hasn't come into his full power yet.

But it's helping solidify what I struggle with about the Romantics in general. I like poetry about nature, but it's too effusive. To me, nature is less about frolicking among the flowers like dryads, and more about the more smells and sounds of crunching through the leaves or stumbling across a little bush of berries.

That's what I like about Robert Frost (and Gerard Manley Hopkins too). His impressions of the world feel more directly observed. They may use that to point to a higher reality but they are firmly standing on a particular patch of ground looking at a particular tree.

Maybe I'm being unfair, maybe I just haven't read enough to appreciate what the Romantics are doing but that's where I'm at now.
