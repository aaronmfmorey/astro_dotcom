You often hear it said in the business world "This meeting could have been an email." Which is to say, the content of this communication was not fitting to the medium. I sometimes think, along similar lines, "This poem could have been an essay." I started writing this before I had a specific example at hand, but the [Louise Glück poem in this week's _Washington Review of Books_](https://www.washingreview.com/p/wrbjan-11-2022?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=725759&post_id=96002454&isFreemail=true&utm_medium=email) is one. I'm not picking on Glück specifically, you probably can think of plenty yourself. It might actually be good writing, but it's barely gesturing at the form of poetry. The kind of poem, where if you removed the line breaks you would find perectly serviceable prose, but without much evidence of meter or scansion.

I have taken the liberty, as a guy who reads stuff, of fixing the Poet Laureate's writing. With just a little added punctuation, you'd get a paragraph. But a paragraph with real punch, it's power increased rather than decreased by not being squeezed into a particular form.

> Over the still world, a bird calls, waking solitary among black boughs. You wanted to be born; I let you be born. When has my grief ever gotten in the way of your pleasure? Plunging ahead into the dark and light at the same time, eager for sensation as though you were some new thing, wanting to express yourselves: all brilliance, all vivacity. Never thinking this would cost you anything, never imagining the sound of my voice as anything but part of you. You won’t hear it in the other world, not clearly again, not in birdcall or human cry, not the clear sound. Only persistent echoing in all sound that means good-bye, good-bye—the one continuous line that binds us to each other.

Perhaps we need a new genre. I suspect in many cases a writer chooses the form of poetry for these could-have-been-an-essay poems because "poet" is a role that exists in literature. "Poetry" is a genre that gets published in literary journals. Maybe we should glorify the short prose vignette. Not quite a short story, not quite a poem, not quite an essay, just some words recording a striking impression.

Obviously, I worry while writing this that I'm a philistine. Maybe I'm just tone deaf. But this is what I see and what I think, and I suppose that's what my personal website is for.
