I like long sentences. Like reading 'em. Like writing 'em. I think it's because they mimic the way people think and speak. If you listen to people speaking conversationally, you'll notice it's hard to find where you would place a period. The speaker makes a statement, adds an and, follows it with a but, goes down a parenthetical, usually as one long-flowing thought.

It's one reason I love late 18th-early 20th century English writers, they weren't afraid of subclauses. My favorite prose is the kind you almost don't feel like you're reading at all, that feels like you're having the scene sent directly to your mind unmediated. Trollope, Austen, Waugh, Proust (Moncrief? I don't know how much you credit him for stylistic choices) at times, all can string a sentence together in such a way that you feel like you're following a smarter and better organized version your own internal monologue. Even when the imagery described is vivid, the prose avoids distracting its reader by drawing attention to itself.

Tangent: this is why I struggle with writing that is intentionally stream of consciousness. The flow of the writing, the tangents and free association, becomes the point in itself rather than serving the narrative. Maybe I'm an unsophisticated reader, maybe I just haven't read the right things. But here I am.
