The song _Until I Fall Away_ by the Gin Blossoms has a strange grammatical construct in the first sentence:

> I want to tell if I am or I am not myself
> 
> Gin Blossoms, _[Until I Fall Away](https://genius.com/Gin-blossoms-until-i-fall-away-lyrics)_

"Tell" in its "discern" sense isn't really used like that. I assume this form of "tell" comes from a usage like "I can't tell you for sure, if I am myself" that got shortened to take the second person out of it.

In normal usage it only goes with "can" or "able to" verbs. You might say "I can tell it's going to rain" or "I'll be able to tell once I get the documentation." You don't just say "I tell it will rain" or even "I hope to tell from the initial results."

I'd never noticed how quirky the standard usage is before coming across the example of it being used wrong\*. I wonder how many other verbs are like that?

\* I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they're probably using poetic license and the "wrong" phrasing is intentional.
