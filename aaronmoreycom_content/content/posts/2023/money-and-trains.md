I came across this quote thrown, more or less tangentially, into [an article about other things](https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/fames-shadow/):

> Since, as Saul Bellow said at his funeral, “Allan \[Bloom\]’s idea of what to do with money was to throw it off the end of a train”

This is almost identical to a line from Tom Waits's song "Long Way Home":

> Money's just something you throw
>
> Off the back of a train

Bloom died in 1992, while "Long Way Home" was written in 2002. Is this an existing phrase I was unaware of before hearing the Tom Waits song? Or is Waits, for some reason, making an exceedingly obscure literary allusion?

_Edit: I should have credited [The Washington Review of Books](https://open.substack.com/pub/thewashingtonreviewofbooks/p/wrbdec-13-2023?r=2dxjx&utm_medium=ios) for bringing this article to my attention._
