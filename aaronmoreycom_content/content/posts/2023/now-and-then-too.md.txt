I'm not the biggest Beatles fan in the world. I appreciate them, I acknowledge their influence, but I rarely have the urge to put on an album.

But with [Now and Then](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AW55J2zE3N4) being released this week, I was reminded again how rock music to the current day is still basically a reaction to the Beatles. That opening riff is [Run](https://youtu.be/AOBs8dU4Pb8?feature=shared), only Run was written almost 40 years later and in all likelihood Snow Patrol was unaware of the song.

You can see the through-lines immediately: The Beatles wall of sound to bombastic prog rock to The Edge's intentionally pared down riffs into Radiohead, Snow Patrol, Coldplay. Those guys heard "Because" at a certain formative age and never got it out of their head. So much\* of the last half century of rock has been bands adjusting the "jangle <-> noodle" and "hard <-> melodic" sliders on the Beatles' basic sound.

\* "'So much' How much exactly?" My broad theory is that Americana/roots rock comes down the line of country-western and folk -> Dylan -> Springsteen / Seeger / Neil Young -> Petty -> Yacht rock / modernish bands starting with "The". Then blues -> Hendrix / Led Zepplin -> Southern rock / Hard rock / Metal. Then the Beatles -> prog rock -> U2 / arena rock -> early Radiohead, et. al. Obviously these are broad strokes with lots of cross-pollination.
