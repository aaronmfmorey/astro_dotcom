The temperatures are coming down, so naturally I'm listening to _Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You_. A particular section of Time Escaping jumped out at me.

> Poison in the ether
> 
> Swinging still incessant pendulum   
> Lavender, nettle, calendula   
> Separate, contact, concentrate   
> Drawing out the fever
> 
> Time escaping  
> Time escaping
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> Only the winter wind survives  
> After the heat rush feeds and thrives  
> After the bushfire burns and dies  
> Frozen and bitter
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> What do the weeds say? They say
> 
> "Everything, everything, everything falls through   
> Each dimension breaks in two   
> Like the two hands clapping   
> Like the two wings flapping
> 
> Everything, everything, everything for free   
> As it all eventually   
> Turns to dust and petal   
> Molten rock and meadow"
> 
> Time escaping  
> Time escaping
> 
> Time Escaping, Big Theif

This is a zany Gerard Manley Hopkins verse. Same eye for the impressions of nature, same sense that it's all falling away. A bit goofier. I'd read a book of poetry like this, if someone today is writing it.
