> And a hound that lay there raised his head and pricked up his ears, Argos, the hound of Odysseus, of the steadfast heart…There lay the hound Argos, full of vermin; yet even now, when he marked Odysseus standing near, he wagged his tail and dropped both his ears, but nearer to his master he had no longer strength to move.

All the little reminders of Fitz are still there: the water bowl and half-eaten last meal, the dog bed we set up next to our workspace when quarantine started, the little reminder in the back of my head getting ready for bed "Did you take him out to pee yet?" We're going to have to pick them all that stuff up tomorrow and pack it away, there's just not a lot of room for sentimentally wasted floor space in a house full of kid's toys.

He was a fluffy teddy bear, but the hair belied the powerful dog underneath. I saw a video of a pack of wolves the other day and was struck by the thought that they moved like him: confidently, no predators, in control of whatever situation he found himself in. An old neighbor had a mastiff three times his size, and Fitz roughhoused with him as though they were equals. Another time, an opposing team was trying to start trouble at a softball game. When he saw me losing my temper, even watching from the sidelines, he started barking at them along with me.

But he was magnanimous: his confident strength allowed him to be gentle and funny with us, his pack. He let the baby crawl all over him like his own pup. The toddler was the only person who could take toys straight out of his mouth without protest.
