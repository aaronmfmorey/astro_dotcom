Tonight in his Christmas vigil homily, our pastor referenced Robert Frost's _Death of the Hired Man_: "Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in." I didn't fully catch his point, I was wrestling a squirrely toddler at that moment, but it occurred to me the poem is something of an inverted Nativity.

An old man (not a baby) comes to a sleep in a barn, but is given a bed in the home. He's looking to receive (rather than give) salvation: "And nothing to look backward to with pride / And nothing to look forward to with hope" and "He never did a thing so very bad / He doesn't know why he isn't quite as good / As anybody. Worthless though he is". Rather than coming to be born in the night, he dies, with the three ("The moon, the silver cloud, and she") standing watch.
