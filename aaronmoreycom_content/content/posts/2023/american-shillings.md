I was surprised while reading _Moby Dick_ to see the price of a drink at a bar described as "The Cape Horn measure, which you may gulph down for a shilling."

The book was written in 1851, and seemingly set in the same time period. What were people doing paying with shillings?

On to [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling), where I found this:

> Due to ongoing shortages of US coins in some regions, shillings continued to circulate well into the nineteenth century. Shillings are described as the standard monetary unit throughout the autobiography of [Solomon Northup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Northup) (1853) and mentioned several times in the [Horatio Alger Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger_Jr.) story _[Ragged Dick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragged_Dick)_ (1868). Prices in an 1859 advertisement in a Chicago newspaper were given in dollars and shillings.

Interesting that lesser known works were included there, when one of the most famous American novels ever written also contains an example.
