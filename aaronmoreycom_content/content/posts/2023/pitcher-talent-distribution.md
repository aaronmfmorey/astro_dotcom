It’s no secret the Cardinals need pitching, pitching, pitching this offseason. They have a decent number of likely average-ish arms, but what they really need is a top-tier pitcher or two to separate themselves from the pack. We can assume they’ll hit ok, but we can’t trust the defense to be great so the pitching needs to pick up a lot of the slack on the run prevention side.

Looking around the league, I was struck by how few highly valuable pitchers there are, regardless of price or availability. I’ve worried for a couple of seasons that pitchers are becoming increasingly fungible. It looks true here. Is it a trend?

I decided to do a Fangraphs search on all pitchers who throw 100+ innings as a starter. How many of them were top-tier (4+ fWAR)? How many of them were average-ish? Is the middle growing at the expense of the top?

Trend lines of top WAR pitchers vs. middle WAR pitchers

It kind of seems like it! The trend is erratic, but it seems the population of top level pitchers is trending down and the relatively undifferentiated middle is trending up.
