I don't know whether this has been written about somewhere, but I just finished _Swann's Way_. The whole novel feels like an inspiration for Peace (this is not itself a novel thought), but I am starting to think Aunt Olivia is a standin for Odette de Crecy:

- She's a woman with a loose reputation

- She's a Sinophole

- The young boy narrator is strangely fascinated with her

- She eventually marries into wealth, but is not faithful

The more I think about it, Swann and Julius Smart are also parallel characters: fascinating _nouveau riche_ adoptive uncles to the generationally wealthy young narrator.
