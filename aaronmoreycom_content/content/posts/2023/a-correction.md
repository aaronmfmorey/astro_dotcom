I was [hard on Yeats a while back](/posts/2023/love-yeat-relationships) when I started reading a collection of his poems. The early ones were rough, but he's improved greatly as it's gone on (the collection appears to be roughly chronological). The line _"What made us dream that he could comb grey_ _hair?"_ took my breath away.
