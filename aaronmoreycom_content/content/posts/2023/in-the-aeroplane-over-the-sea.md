Because my music knowledge is more deep than broad, I recently listened for the first time to Neutral Milk Hotel's critically acclaimed _In The Aeroplane Over the Sea._ My buddy Scott (hey man, if you're reading this, what's up?) was pushing it in like 2003 and I never got around to it, for one reason or another.

To go off on a tangent that I promise will come around, U2 was the first "before my time" band that I got into in my formative music listening high school years. It was a shock, putting on _Joshua Tree_ or _Achtung Baby_ to hear the sounds some of my favorite current bands were playing 10+ years later. It was probably the first time I experienced the sense of "oh, _that's_ who those guys were listening to!"

Bringing it back to _ITAOTS_, I have to confess my first thought was "Is this a long-lost Decemberists album?" Which is to say, through no fault of its own, it suffers from being wildly influential. I've "already heard" these songs through the afore-mentioned Decemberists, Sufjan Stevens, even Big Thief. And it's probably fair to consider the album as part of a conversation with other bands I've heard more of like Wilco, Danielson Famile, maybe Bright Eyes? I can't experience the music in its originality any more than I can erase from my mind the now-cliches Shakespeare coined to read his plays fresh.

That said, the songs are good. I described the melodies on _Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You_ (ugh, these bands' titles) as "primal." So well-constructed you feel as though you've known them all your life. Like they've always just existed out in the universe. There's a lot of that here too. I listened once and then was already humming along and picking up lyrics on the second pass through.

That said, it has some of the flaws of a pioneer effort. The final product is less polished than it is ambitious. Lines about semen-stained mountain tops come across as more puerile than thought-provoking. There's a line in _God At The Ritz_ by Lorenzo Albacetti, where he meditates on the way we experience being embodied. He wonders if it's jarring for a mortician to say "this body" at work and come home to praise "your body" to his wife. There is some of that confusion in the album viewpoint character's relationship to Anne Frank that feels more disordered than deep, possibly because I'm 37 and not 17.

What can I say? I feel like The Paris Review being asked to answer the question of whether Paris is good. It's there, it's lasted the test of time, it's near impossible to imagine a counterfactual world where it doesn't exist. Am I hubristic enough to rate it?
