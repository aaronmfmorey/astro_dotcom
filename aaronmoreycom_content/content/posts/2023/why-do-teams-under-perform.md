This is a thought exercise for me. I’m trying to suss out the different levels of “poor performance” that a team can have, and think about how much of it is attributable to bad luck, poor preparation, or just the weirdness of baseball.

I posted this originally as a comment over at Viva El Birdos, but I’m putting it here a little more fleshed out for my own reference. If anyone can think of a level I’m missing, I’m open to suggestions.

I think of this something like that Aristotelian/Thomistic Four Causes. When you want to understand what a thing is, there are different levels to that question. They roughly correspond to “What is it made of”, “How is it configured”, “How did it get to be that way” and “What’s it for”. If you buy into this philosophical system there’s an answer to each of these questions for every thing that exists. They aren’t mutually exclusive, they’re hierarchical. Or maybe it helps to think of them like nesting dolls, each building on the last.

**The Five Reasons**

1) A team’s players aren’t good enough. Maybe a person with limited baseball knowledge would look at the roster and think “Hey, that looks like a good team” but the projections don’t bear it out. For example, you might look at a team that has Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani and assume they’ll be good but you’ll be wrong year in and year out.

2) Players under-performing expectations. For example, Adam Wainwright’s 80/50/20th percentile ZiPS projection before the 2023 season was 2.7/1.9/0.7 fWAR but instead he’s -0.4.

3) Player performance not leading to runs scored/leading to too many runs given up. The 2023 Cardinals are, as of August 23, -8 wins from their BaseRuns expected win/loss record. They are 28th in Fangraph’s clutch metric for hitters and also 28th for pitchers.

4) Sequencing of runs not leading to wins. For example, the Cardinals’ bullpen is middle of the pack in ERA while leading the league in blown saves. They are 3 wins worse than what their Pythag projects their record should be.

5) Random bullshit: umpires blowing key calls, BABIP running 30 points higher than expected, awful 1-run record. It’s hard to quantify this, but you know it when you see it.

I’m not yet prepared to argue which or any of this is bad luck, as opposed to lack of true talent or coaching mismanagement. But this is a good starting point for thinking about in what ways a team fails to perform to expectations.
