I just finished _Little, Big_ and I felt like I was following along well until the last 75 pages or so. Around that point, things got very abstract. I think _Alice Through The Looking Glass_ might be a key to piecing it together.

- The co-protagonist is named Alice. I really should have seen this coming! She ultimately (spoiler) is the first of the members of the Tale to pass through to the other world.

- Ariel Hawksquill observes that the the Zodiac on the ceiling of the subway station has reversed. She's gone through to the Other Side.

- The precipitating event for the reversal is an enormous shattering bang in the distance. This has been foreshadowed by a group of movers dropping a mirror.

- The sleeping Red King!

- I wonder if there's a Tweedledee and Tweedledum analogue that I missed?
