Only 30 years too late, I'm listening to the Gin Blossoms' _New Miserable Experience_. I've sometimes heard people comment that the “you can trust me not to think” line from Hey Jealousy would make more sense as “you can trust me not to _drink_.” But in the context of the rest of the album, it's clear he recognizes “not drinking” is something you absolutely cannot trust him to do.

The more I sit with this album, I'm convinced it's the perfect power pop record. There's not a bad song, and the lyrics are melancholic enough to add gravitas to the pop arrangements. But there's a tinge of guilt listening in retrospect: you can hear the man drinking himself to death with every line.
