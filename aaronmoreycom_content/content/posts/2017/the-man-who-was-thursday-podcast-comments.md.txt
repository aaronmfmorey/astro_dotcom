_Note: I’ve posted about Gene Wolfe here before, and I plan to do so again soon. If you’re a fan, you absolutely must listen to the brilliant [Alzabo Soup](http://alzabosoup.libsyn.com/) pod_cast. They did a series on Gene Wolfe’s influences, including an _[episode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/alzabo-soup/id1150623452?mt=2&i=1000391982399)_ on the patron of this blog: GK Chesterton. I’_m working on a couple of longer pieces about_ The Man Who Was Thursday _as a whole, but I’m going to start with general comments inspired by the podcast itself._

OO—OO

**Chesterton’s Size**

There’s a story that he was walking down the street during World War I, when a woman thought he was shirking military service and asked “Why aren’t you out at the front?” He replied “Go around to the side, madam, and you’ll see that I am.”

OO—OO

**Oscar Wilde**

Chesterton references Oscar Wilde with a not-very-veiled allusion in the opening poem of _The Man Who Was Thursday:_

> And the Green Carnation withered 
> 
> As in forest fires that pass

Oscar Wilde and his companions distinguished themselves by wearing green carnations in their lapels. The flower, in a color that doesn’t occur naturally, symbolized decadence and a taste for the unnatural (Wilde never explicitly said so, as far as I’ve read, but the connection to his homosexuality seems clear).

Chesterton intends for the opening poem to state a sort of thesis for the whole book: a defense of the goodness of Creation and a rejection of the unnatural. I have another post in progress that will expand on this point.

OO—OO

**“Vices”**

Regarding the comment about “indulging in vices,” it’s not traditional Christian teaching that drinking or smoking are sinful in themselves. They should be indulged in moderation, of course (something Chesterton himself may have struggled with). One quip that describes Chesterton’s view on morality comes from his play Manalive:

>  This man’s spiritual power has been precisely this, that he has distinguished between custom and creed. He has broken the conventions, but he has kept the commandments.

OO—OO

**Chesterton’s Influence on Gene Wolfe**

I think the clearest stylistic takeaway is his impressionistic writing style. Like Chesterton, Wolfe prefers to describe the appearance of what characters are seeing in terms of colors and shapes, allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions as to _what_ they are seeing. Often, this impression is misleading and allows the author subvert the reader’s expectations.

On a larger scale, Wolfe shares with Chesterton (and many other Catholic authors: JRR Tolkien, Flannery O’Connor, Graham Greene, etc.) the idea that literature need not be didactic to be authentically Catholic. The Catholic faith is a worldview that affects how people think, interact with one another, and how the universe around them operates. This makes it possible for an author to build a Catholic universe within their works, without directly preaching the dogmas of the faith. Fr. Brown is a good example of this principle in action. He doesn’t just depend on pure rationality, he works from an understanding of human nature.

OO—OO

**One God**

In regard to the discussion of “one God” around the 70 minute mark, Chesterton’s view was that most religions began as monotheism and became polytheistic as they incorporated natural elements and neighboring gods into their pantheon. (This is a paraphrase from The Everlasting Man, which I haven’t read in a while, so I hope I’m doing it justice)

OO—OO

**Distributism**

This part is where I get in a bit over my head. Distributism can be difficult to pin down because its principles are largely moral rather than mathematical or systematic. I don’t know of anything in distributism analogous to the supply and demand curve or the Nash equilibrium.

The hosts swung between calling distributism socialistic then libertarian, which is typical. Distributists deny that they are a compromise between the two, and insist that they represent a Third Way entirely.

Distibutist theory starts from the 19th century papal writing on the rights of workers, such as the encyclical Rerum Novarum. One of the major principles is subsidiarity: the idea that things should be governed at the lowest level feasible. For example, a local school board is best suited to decide the curriculum for a town’s schools, while it is more proper for a national military hierarchy to make decisions for the nation’s defense. The reason for this is that the closer an issue is to the people affected by it, the more likely it is that the solution respects the affected as humans, rather than cogs in a machine. (I would consider this a type of Christian humanism, but many Catholics don’t like the baggage associated with that term.)

From subsidiarity, it follows that society should prefer small, local, individually-owned businesses and only allow companies to be as large as necessary to do their work. Distributists oppose both socialism (where all property is owned by the collective) and big-business capitalism (where corporations own the means of production and workers work for a salary without ownership or a decision-making stake). A couple of comments Chesterton made in this area:

I don’t want to drone on much longer, thanks again to Alzabo Soup for their great podcast! I’ll be back with more on _The Man Who Was Thursday_ soon.
