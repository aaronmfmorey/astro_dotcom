There's a striking chapter in Gene Wolfe's _Book of the New Sun_ series, where the main characters capture a member of the enemy army called the Ascians. The Ascians are so brainwashed that they can't speak any sentences that aren't one of a dozen or so official government slogans. Two other members in the camp attempt to get him to communicate with them. One asks questions and the other translates the slogans to English speech. The exchanges go like this (per Wikipedia):

> Ascian: In times past, loyalty to the cause of the populace was to be found everywhere. The will of the Group of Seventeen was the will of everyone
> 
> Interpreter: Once upon a time…

or 

> A: Where the Group of Seventeen sit, there final justice is done.
> 
> I: He went to the capital and complained of the way he had been treated.

It's not clear whether the the Ascian is actually meaning to say any of these things or if they're merely empty expressions that the interpreter is extrapolating on his own. It's a dryly humorous scene, and I'd be curious to see if rereading the book leads me to change my mind on the subject.

Why am I writing this, you ask? [Who knows? When has science fiction ever been a metaphor for real life?](http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/benjamin-hochman/hochman-cards-stuck-between-a-trade-and-a-hard-place/article_8fea568e-8c79-5cca-9206-f397014b3c10.amp.html)
