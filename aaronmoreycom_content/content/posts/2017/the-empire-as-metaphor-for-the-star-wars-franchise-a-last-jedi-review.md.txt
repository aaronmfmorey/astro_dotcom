_Here There Be Spoilers_

It’s a well-worn trope at this point that Storm Troopers can’t shoot straight. A dozen of them inevitably go bumbling toward three unarmored protagonists and end in a heap of twisted limbs and melted plastic. The Empire (yeah, yeah, “The First Order”; I’m going to go ahead and call it all “The Empire” and you can direct your complaints to [/dev/null](https://askubuntu.com/questions/12098/what-does-outputting-to-dev-null-accomplish-in-bash-scripts)) only has three general ideas: giant destroyers , oceans of infantry and a couple of Force-powered sociopaths in charge. So what is it that makes the Empire so feared?

Resources! Wipe out a platoon of Storm Troopers, and there are ten more right behind. Blow up their enormous warship/satellite/mass-destruction-device and they’ve got another one coming right out of wherever it is planet-sized war equipment gets manufactured. Their strength and riches make them lazy. Why bother to protect your exhaust port when you can just pop out another destroyer? Why teach your Storm Troopers basic marksmanship when you can just roll more of them off the assembly line when the old ones end up full of holes?

Lucas Film has apparently learned this lesson themselves. Like the Empire (or Taco Bell), their only recipe is to take the same handful of ingredients and mix them up in different combinations forever. And they get away with it! Because they have endless resources, they can keep creating technologically-impressive, bumbling monstrosities basically forever.

Remember the battle on Hoth? Well, here’s another battle against Imperial Walkers on a snow planet! Oops, actually the creators go out of their way to show a guy eating the snow and it turns out to be salt. Totally different! As to why it’s _snowing_ salt…you tell me.

Remember the cool-looking villain they hyped up in The Phantom Menace, only to kill him off pretty much immediately? Well, hold onto your hats, this time they hyped up a cool-looking villian, only to kill HER off pretty much immediately!

I mostly liked The Force Awakens, because it felt like an old-school Star Wars movie. Despite its flaws, it gave the feel of a live-action adventure movie and kept the CGI bloat to a minimum. The plot line wasn’t terribly original, but it was clear what was happening and why.

Somehow The Last Jedi took all of those familiar ingredients and mixed them up into something that was largely incoherent. I’ll admit I haven’t spent much time perusing Wookiepedia to identify ship models, but in the opening battle scene I couldn’t tell which side’s ships were being destroyed. Something was blowing up, and I was asking myself “Is that good or bad?”

Who was Rose? A frazzled newbie? A grizzled veteran? Through some combination of makeup, lighting, CGI and frumpy haircut, I got the varying impression she was somewhere between 25 and 45. I looked it up and the actress is 28 and a bit baby-faced, so I don’t know what went wrong. It felt like the Young Frankenstein joke where Igor’s hump keeps changing sides. That wouldn’t normally be that big of a deal, but there was some kind of (sexual?) tension between her and Finn that would make a lot less sense if she was his mother’s age.

Why does Snoke chastise Kylo for failing to live up to the legacy of Darth Vader? Kylo went soft and failed to finish the rebels while had the chance. Unlike Darth Vader who turned away from the dark side out of love for his son and killed the Emperor…

Other times, characters were doing things and I couldn’t tell why. What was the entire subplot about finding the decryption expert? Our fearless heroes want to break into the Empire battleship, so they call…the wrinkly old alien lady who was in the last movie for like 5 minutes?…who takes their call in the middle of a shootout?…which is unrelated to this movie, I assume?…and she tells them to go to this other planet and find the only decryption expert in the galaxy who could possibly get the job done?…so they go with the random guy in the drunk tank instead?…but none of it matters because they don’t deactivate the tracker and the rebels have to do something else entirely…? I guess that’s what happened. Like I said, it’s not terribly coherent.

Also, Princess Leia can use the Force, apparently. If I were her, I might have taken advantage of that power earlier. On the other hand, if she only had one burst of Force in her, she certainly picked her spot well.

That’s not to say I hated everything about the movie. The scenes on Luke’s planet were mainly good. I liked the long-distance connection between Rey and Kylo Ren. There was an interesting moment where Rey asked to see her parents in the mystical mirror. Two shadowy figures approached, but as they came nearer they merged into one face—her own. I thought that was a touching expression of an orphan’s experience of family: ultimately all she knows of her parents is that they somehow combined to create her.

Ultimately the sensation of viewing this movie was like a dream I might have had after an evening of watching Star Wars when I was 12. All the basic elements were there, but the logic doesn’t hold up to scrutiny once you find yourself back in the light of day.

_Ok, I should explain the “Han Solo Scriptura” joke. At the end, we see that the Jedi holy books are stowed away in the Millennium Falcon. With Luke dead, the last connection to the unbroken tradition of the Jedi Order is gone. The remaining Force users are going to be forced to recreate the religion from scratch using only their own understanding of the holy books. What could go wrong?_
