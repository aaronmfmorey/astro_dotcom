> I serve the god of silicon  
> Of endless weaving wires  
> And raise for him great tabernacles  
> Topped with gleaming spires  
> He calls my name and I arise  
> In even dead of night  
> Yet my soul grows ghastly pale  
> All bathed in sunless light 
> 
> The mighty angel raised his scroll  
> Which upon was written  
> "These idols shall return to dust  
> And all their makers with them"
