I tried something new last night. Looking for rye whiskey cocktails, I came across the Sazerac. I'm not really into 
anise so I decided to improvise. Behold: the Cluniac

## Ingredients
- 2 oz rye whiskey
- Tsp simple syrup
- 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters
- Lemon twist
- Splash of Benedictine

## Directions
1. Chill an Old Fashioned glass in the freezer for at least a few minutes
2. Splash the Benedictine into the chilled glass
3. Swirl it until it just coats the inside of the glass. Pour out any remainder (or swig it, waste not...)
4. Add the rest of the ingredients over an ice cube

Benedictine is thicker than most liqueurs, so it needed the ice. It still came out thicker and more herbal than I'd 
like. But I'm so proud of the name, I hate to abandon it entirely. I'm open to suggestions in the comments.
