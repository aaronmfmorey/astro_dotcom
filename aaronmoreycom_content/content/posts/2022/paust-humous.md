I [posted a while back](/posts/2022/ok-now-persuade-me/) about the title of _Persuasion_. It seemed out of place to me. 
Today I happened to be looking at the _Persuasion_ Wikipedia entry and found this helpful note:

> The book's title is not Jane Austen's but her brother Henry's, who named it after her early death. There is no known
> source that documents what Austen intended to call her novel. Whatever her intentions might have been, Austen spoke
> of the novel as _The Elliots_, according to family tradition, and some critics believe that is probably the title she planned for it.
