My wife and I took a date day this weekend including a trip to the Milwaukee Art Museum. Built along the edge of 
beautiful Lake Michigan, and designed by renowned architect Santiago Calatrava[^1], it's home to much more and much higher 
quality art than you would expect if you aren't from Milwaukee or haven't visited.

[^1]: Is he renowned? I don't know anything about modern architects.

I have to mention first a painting I don't think I had ever seen before. So help me, I'm a shallow man, but _The 
Catastrophe_ by Eduard von Grützner affected me more viscerally than any painting I think I've ever seen in my life. 
Nestled among staid realist works, a vintner monk [is falling down the stairs.](https://collection.mam.org/details.php?id=11435) Every detail is perfect. I 
laughed and laughed aloud in the middle of the hushed gallery.

On a more serious monastic note, we of course had to stop and see Zurbarán's [_St. Francis of Assisi in his Tomb_.](https://blog.mam.org/2017/06/27/from-the-collection-francisco-de-zurbarans-saint-francis-of-assisi-in-his-tomb/) 
Somehow, in spite of seeing this painting in person a number of times and having a framed print hanging in my house, I'd 
never noticed a slight red mark on his chest. It's so faint I almost thought it was a smudge or damage. But getting up
very close (closer probably than I could have gotten if security had been watching closely), it was definitely under the 
glaze, in the same layer as the other paint strokes. It must be Francis's stigmata glowing through his habit. 
Strangely, it's on his right. I always think of Jesus as being pierced in the heart. But maybe if you're trying to stab 
someone through the heart with a spear from below, you go up from the right and diagonally through the chest cavity. 
The Bible doesn't specify, but a quick browse through depictions of the crucifixion seems show artists overwhelmingly 
favoring the right. So now you know!
