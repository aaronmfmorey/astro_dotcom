Today (first Sunday of Lent), the Liturgy of the Hours offers two choices for the closing prayer of Morning Prayer/Mid-Day Prayer.

Usually the alternative prayer at least carries the same gist as the first prayer, sometimes in slightly more elevated language. But these aren't even close! What's going on here?

To the Latin!

I didn't sit down with a dictionary and fully translate it out, it's clearly much closer to the first. The Latin (at least as it's shown in the iBreviary app), doesn't include the Alternative Prayer at all. So who wrote this? Did ICEL have some guy go rogue and start creating their own non-standard prayers? Are they authorized to add alternative prayers not in the Latin? Or is this in an appendix somewhere but not contained in the main Latin text, like the Psalm Prayers?
