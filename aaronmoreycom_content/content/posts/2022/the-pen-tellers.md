I just read a very nice [blog post about showing vs. telling in writing](https://medium.com/adams-notebook/on-showing-not-telling-9ef276b05782).
Read it first. He's a real writer, I'm a dabbler in posting. I won't say anything he hasn't said better already.

But it brought my mind back to my personal philosophy that a writer's job is not to write to the rules (whether stuffy
Strunk and White-ish formalisms, or the counter-reaction to them). The writer's one job is to write _well_.

"Ok, but what rules will lead to me writing well?" I hear you ask, you poor soul. There is not one set of rules. The
only rule is to follow or break the rules in considered, deliberate ways so as to communicate what you want to say or make
your text do what you want it to do. If you're writing a business email clarity is king. Say exactly what you mean to say,
as unambiguously as possible in as few words as necessary. If you're James Joyce, uh, do the opposite of that. Mostly 
you're going to be somewhere in between. Where exactly you fall and how strict to be with your words is what makes
writing a human endeavor. You're not executing an algorithm. Stretch your legs! Enjoy your freedom!
