Shakespeare's sonnet 30 contains the phrase "remembrance of things past", which I assumed must have been alluded to by
the title of Proust's novel, which often goes by that name in English. But Proust originally titled it _Ã€ la recherche
du temps perdu_. The Shakespeare reference was not in fact there in the original. It appears (per Wikipedia) to
have been introduced by the original English translators. That's an interesting choice: I wonder if they attempted to
develop other parallels to that poem (or Shakespeare's larger work), or was it just a reference they assumed the
audience of their time would recognize to bolster their translation's literary credentials?
