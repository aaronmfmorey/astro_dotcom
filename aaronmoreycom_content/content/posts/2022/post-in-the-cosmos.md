  - "Lost In The Cosmos"
---

I finished _Lost in the Cosmos_. What a bizarre book. I don't know if "liked it" is the right description for how I 
felt. The sense I'm left with is that I will be chewing on it for a long while. I'm certain I'll read something three 
years from now and say "Percy already handled that question, it's right there in _Lost in the Cosmos_", much the way I 
often find myself thinking "Thomas already answered that".

Or "Chesterton said...". As I'm about to do right now.

I took a philosophy class in college on the topic of "Technology and Human Nature". I found it infuriating that the 
professor wouldn't propose an answer to the question of "what is human nature?" His answer, and I don't think he was 
being Socratic, always came down to "Who's to say?" What that ultimately meant was his position shook out to there being
no such thing as human nature, and therefore no such thing as a violation of human nature. Whatever technological 
innovation humans are able to devise, and whatever it's consequences, who's to say if it's right or wrong? It just is. 
It's fruitless to oppose it, or ask if we ought to oppose it, progress will march on whether we do or don't.

I feel similarly about what Percy is doing here. [I'm sure he's being sly](/posts/2022/lost-in-lost-in/), but I want him to break out of his 
shtick of "just asking questions". Tell me what you believe, Walker! Stand for something. There's this phrase that 
rattles around in my head that I must have read and forgotten the source because it doesn't feel like my own invention:
"Every investigation eventually becomes a vivisection." You start asking "Why" like a 2 year old over and over and 
eventually every question becomes unanswerable: "Because it just is".

Ever tried to explain a joke to an obtuse or hostile audience? "Why is that funny?" _You explain._ "What's funny about that?" It goes round and round until the joke is thoroughly dead. It can't be funny anymore. You pulled out its entrails and showed them to the audience, but entrails don't function outside the integrity of the whole body. It's dead and what do you have to show for it?

All the talk of sign and symbol and triadic communication may be interesting or even useful as a way of thinking about human thought and how it differs from anything else. But when you start getting too far into your theory and questioning whether you can ever know yourself or others can know you, you need to take a deep breath and get on with your life.

> I mean that if you or I were dealing with a mind that was growing morbid, we should be chiefly concerned not so much to give it arguments as to give it air, to convince it that there was something cleaner and cooler outside the suffocation of a single argument.

At some point you have to go outside. There's a whole world out there that doesn't care if you understand yourself perfectly. As Scott says on the [podcast](https://onlinegreatbooks.com/149-percys-lost-in-the-cosmos-part-1/), you still have to go out and feed the chickens.

As a Christian, I see that there's kind of an answer: there has been a Fall that separated us from God, therefore from goodness in all it's forms: your reason reason, your will, your neighbor. Why? Something to do with a snake and an apple. Why? Because God cast us out of Eden for our sins. But like _why?_

_Gird up your loins now, like a man.  
I will question you, and you tell me the answers!  
Would you refuse to acknowledge my right?  
Would you condemn me that you may be justified?  
Have you an arm like that of God,  
or can you thunder with a voice like his?  
Adorn yourself with grandeur and majesty,  
and clothe yourself with glory and splendor.  
Let loose the fury of your wrath;  
look at everyone who is proud and bring them down.  
Look at everyone who is proud, and humble them.  
Tear down the wicked in their place,  
bury them in the dust together;  
in the hidden world imprison them.  
Then will I too praise you,  
for your own right hand can save you._
