What if anything has been written about Sherlock Holmes novels as Socratic dialogues?

It occurred to me while reading _The Sign of Four_ that Holmes is constantly holding forth on his reasoning process, 
with his friend characters interjecting things like "Yes, surely it must be so", or his cast of nemeses putting in 
competing theories that he must debunk.

Doyle was classically educated. Was he doing this as an intentional homage? Or is this style just in the back of his 
mind when thinking about how expository dialog works?
