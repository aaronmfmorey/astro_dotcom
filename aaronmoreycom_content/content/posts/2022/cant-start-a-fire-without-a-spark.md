I finished _Memento Mori_ over my long disconnected weekend up north. Really wonderfully writing, the characters were mostly awful but in such memorable ways.

I have a half baked theory that Spark is telling us each characters eternal fate through their interactions with the natural world around them. Charmian, at least, settles in a place she calls paradise and shows appreciation for the Mortimers' garden when she visits.

Paradise references are few and far between in comparison to fire, probably the most prominent literary device in the book. Lisa Brooke (who the narrator says offered her late-life celibacy to God) is cremated. Alec Warner's painstaking collection of notes is destroyed in a fire, leaving him for the first time encountering his fellow geriatrics as people and not subjects. _If anyoneâ€™s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet only so as through fire._

The others, to quote Olive Mannering, "Let the fire see the people." Nearly everyone else is shown getting exactly what they want, and being dragged to their bitter end by it.
