These come from Burton Raffel's _How To Read a Poem_, which I am very much enjoying. But I think Raffel misses on this
interpretation because he's not grappling with the meaning of monastic life.

Something that has always stuck with me is an article I read once explaining Chapter 22 of the Rule of St. Benedict ("Let the monks
sleep... not with their knives at their sides, lest they cut themselves in their sleep"). The author's view was that
monks of the 5th century when Benedict lived were often rough men, already living out in the wilderness where the early
monastic fathers went to escape the decadence of the cities. They were outcasts, or outlaws. "Lest they cut themselves"
is sort of a euphemism: really he means something like "Lest they be armed against one another in the night, through
distrust of their brothers."

In that light, the poem's robber is doing penance for his sin through his singing and chanting (of the psalms, to God).
As the dead monk's body decays, so the robber's sins fade away through his acts of penitence. Eventually the robber
becomes the monk, forgetting his sins [even as God has](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Micah-7-19/). But that
doesn't guarantee a happy ending in this life. In his docility, the monk has made himself vulnerable to the aggression
of the rough man in the wilderness. But in the fullness of time, God's will is done.
