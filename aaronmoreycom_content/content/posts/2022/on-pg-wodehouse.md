I loved this [essay about P.G. Wodehouse](https://www.gawker.com/culture/the-brilliant-hackwork-of-pg-wodehouse) from Dan Brooks. Particularly this very Wodehousian line towards the beginning:

> Wodehouse writes like a man who has worked for a living, i.e. with attention to craft and evident determination never to go back.

I appreciate Brown's point about hack work. For entertainment writing, propping up old devices with new facades is often part of the joy of reading that author. You liked that last book? Great news! You grab a another Chesterton novel and you can bet a character who monologues at mini-essay length is going to stumble into a battle for the soul of England. This Gene Wolfe narrator is – gasp! – not telling us the whole truth about what's happening, or who he is. This Jane Austen heroine's future is imperiled by her father's poor financial planning and the wiles of a promiscuous young suitor. Not every piece of literature needs to be groundbreaking to be worthwhile. The pleasure of reading these novels comes from the vivid prose, the sparkling witty dialogue, the comfort of going back to spend time in that world again.
