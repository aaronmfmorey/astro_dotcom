I'm reading Christophe Boltanski's _The Safe House_, and I can't help but relate it to Gene Wolfe's _Peace._ Stories of 
houses built as much from memory and past lives as from physical materials. I'm just a melancholic person, so it's also 
bringing to mind my grandfather's house, the breakfast table where he made us Eggos every morning, and the story he 
told of the stories his Irish grandmother told him of the banshees howling in the night outside their cottage.
