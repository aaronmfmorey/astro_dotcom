_Inspired by this [essay](https://lithub.com/lydia-davis-ten-of-my-recommendations-for-good-writing-habits/), I'm
going to start using my blog more to post small observations. Maybe. Or maybe I'll forget to._

The flock of birds that spends the most time at our feeder (some kind of sparrow, I think), has a definite feeding
hierarchy, but not a strict precedence for the more dominant birds. Instead, there's a kind of weighted scale of
dominance versus desire. A less dominant bird will approach the feeder, and the one currently eating will chase him off.
Then the bird will approach again a few minutes later and the more dominant bird will seemingly weigh his desire to keep
eating against the effort of chasing off the other, and will often yield the feeder. But a minute or two later, he may
decide he's still hungry and approach the feeder again. The bird that took his spot, now less hungry himself, will often
decline to defend his position.
