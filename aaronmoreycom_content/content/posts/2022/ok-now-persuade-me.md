The naming of Jane Austen novels is always interesting to me. Is she trying to say something by the title, or did she just slap a name on it and call it a day? _Sense and Sensibility_ or _Pride and Prejudice?_ Yeah, I get it. _Mansfield Park?_ I don't know. Feels like she was just trying to come up with something to put on the cover.

Having finished _Persuasion,_ I'm stuck in the middle. Of course "persuasion" is a strong theme. Lots of people have their minds changed: Sir Walter to give up his unsustainable lifestyle, Anne not to marry Frederick Wentworth, Mr. Eliot trying to persuade the family that he's trustworthy, pretty much everyone trying to persuade Sir Walter not to marry Mrs. Clay.

But on the other hand, is this not a major theme in all of Austen's novels? She might as well have named it _Suitable Marriages._ Is persuasion a stronger theme here than in, say, _Mansfield Park,_ where both Crawfords are trying to persuade the members of the household to marry them? Where Mary is trying to persuade Edmund not to join the clergy? Where Fanny and Edmund are ultimately persuaded to partake in the play they disapprove of? (It occurs to me you might almost make it a sister story to _Persuasion_ and title it _Perversion_, considering how rarely the persuaders in _MP_ have their subjects' best interest at heart.)

ADDENDUM: I brought this up with my wife after composing but before hitting publish. She suggested this book is probably particularly about characters having their minds changed by the counsel or pressure of a third party. Mrs. Russel working to convince Anne not to marry, rather than Anne being persuaded by her own judgements of Wentworth's character. I think she's onto something with that.
