I'm reading The Library of America's Robert Frost collection. The poetry section is ordered chronologically by publication date of the books the poems were collected in. I just finished _A Boy's Will_, which is (as strange as this sounds to say) very poetic. The poems tend toward a jangly meter and regular-ish rhyme schemes. He's clearly (and I assume intentionally) breaking the rules here and there, but the breaking is the exception.

That leads to a jarring transition coming into his following book _North of Boston._ I'm only 4-5 poems in, but at this point "poem" is only vaguely what he's doing. There are line breaks to suggest verse but next to no rhyming. And if there's any regular meter, I haven't caught onto it yet. He's writing vignettes, little impressions, almost prose, almost long enough to be short stories.

This isn't just a departure from his early work. It's also a departure from the later work that he's best known for. Poems like _The Road Not Taken_ or _Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening_ are much more obviously poetical. It makes me wonder what happened between the publishing of _A Boy's Will_ and _North of Boston._ Did he just want to try something different? Or was he already writing in both these styles and he purposely divided them into separate books?
