> Maurice Sendak's work has influenced countless other writers and artists, but who influenced him?

This note appears in the latest [Washington Review of Books](https://www.washingreview.com/p/wrbnov-2022-childrens-literature?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=725759&post_id=85631366&isFreemail=true&utm_medium=email). I don't think it's a silly thing to think, it's a perceptive thing for a child to have noted. _Where The Wild Things Are_ is meant to be a little disturbing, I think.

For child-me, this was the attraction of the book. It takes the child out is the cozy comfort zone of much of children's literate and makes them do some work. What was going on with Max? Why did he have a wolf suit, and why did it make him behave that way? How did the jungle spring up out of his room? Was it real? What were the Wild Things up to before he got there? Did they have some kind of society? Sendak doesn't try to answer any of this. He drops you into this strange almost-like-ours world and shows you just a little bit. The rest remains on the periphery, in the corner of your eye asking your imagination to fill in the details.

As a kid, I couldn't get enough of it. It opened up that part of my mind that later latched onto sci-fi and fantasy novels. To _The Lord of the Rings_, and Gene Wolfe. To Poe and Lovecraft and weird fiction.

There's an important place for coziness in children's literature. For Little Bear and Frog and Toad encouraging kindness and friendship. But there's also a place, for a certain kind of kid at least, for opening up the world in all its weirdness and wonder, it's ancient civilizations and exotic cultures. There are mysteries across the sea, and within each of the quiet lives passing by us on the street and in the knotholes the next tree, if we have our eyes open to then.
