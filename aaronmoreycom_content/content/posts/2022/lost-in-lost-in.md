I'm reading _Lost In The Cosmos_ (Walker Percy) at the advice if a friend (hi Charlie, how's the farm?) and to keep up with the Online Great Books podcast (hi Karl and Scott, how are the farms?).

About a third of the way through it, as I am, one can't shake the nagging sense Percy is playing some kind of joke on you. That he's not saying what he really means, or at least not all of what he means, or (I think this is the most likely) saying so many things that what he means remains hidden in plain sight.

When you've finished the first twelve questions, he drops in a section about semiotics with a note mentioning that you don't really need to read this section if you don't want to. It makes my ears perk up: if this were Gene Wolfe I would understand that he's screaming at me "The key to the whole thing is right here." Is that what Percy is doing? Or is he just noodling on about something he finds interesting, laughing at the thought of a bunch of readers slogging through it in frustration? The three-page footnote referring to the second word of the chapter title suggests he takes this very seriously, but it also reads as a droll joke at his own expense. He very nearly says this in the introduction to the section: That lay readers will find it too technical and experts will find it too simplified. The Author alone understands what The Author has written, and maybe not even him.
