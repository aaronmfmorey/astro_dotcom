I think I was like 30 before I realized "The first Noel / The angels did say" meant "The very first Christmas greeting the angels gave" rather than "'The first Noel!', the angels said".

_Q: Ok, but what did you think that "to certain poor shepherds" part was about?_

A: I guess I assumed "certain" was some kind of archaic way of saying "reassure". As in "The angels said 'It's the very first Christmas!' in order to reassure some shepherds who were surely somewhat rattled by the spectacle of all the hosts of heaven appearing in their midst." That seems relatable.
