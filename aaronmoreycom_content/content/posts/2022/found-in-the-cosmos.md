In relation to my [previous post about _Lost In The Cosmos_](/posts/2022/lost-in-lost-in/), I found [an essay by Allen Jacobs on the book](http://ayjay.org/Cosmos.pdf).

First of all I'm a little salty that Jacobs beat me to the connection to Kierkegaard's _Fear and Trembling_. It's fine, just imagine I had written what he writes there. I'm sure I would have been equally insightful.

But later on in the essay I was struck by a direction Jacobs, on his way to a different point, didn't take. He quotes a soliloquy from The Jodie Foster Character in the movie Contact, about the impossibility of denying that she had really met the aliens when there was no other evidence to prove it:

> Because I can't. I … had an experience … I can't prove it, I can't even explain it, but everything that I know as a human being, everything that I am tells me that it was real. I was given something wonderful, something that changed me forever … A vision … of the universe, that tells us, undeniably, how tiny, and insignificant and how … rare, and precious we all are. A vision that tells us that we belong to something that is greater than ourselves, that we are not, that none of us are alone! I wish … I … could share that … I wish, that everyone, if only for one … moment, could feel … that awe, and humility, and hope. But … That continues to be my wish.

Jacobs follows up by noting "And one more layer of irony: many times over the years I have seen this speech claimed by Christians as expressing their own commitment to belief in the face of skepticism and scorn."

He's not wrong, that Christians might find that line reassuring in the face of secular mockery (or incomprehension). But I find myself almost more often addressing that sentiment to God.

I had something of a mystical experience in Eucharistic adoration as a teenager. I won't bother to go much further into detail here: like Jodie Foster says, I know it happened and I know it would sound like nothing at all to anyone who hasn't had a similar experience. So there it leaves me, commanded by God to "preach the Gospel to all the nations." Convinced by God that following His commands is the key to a life well lived and eternity with Him in Heaven. Convinced I have to share a Gospel message I, personally, only find convincing because God Himself confirmed it to me.

How can I convey this incomprehensible message, when I am (as I have always expected, and my randomly-assigned freshmen college roommate confirmed verbatim) "a strange little man."[^1]. Ironically, given my given name, I'm in the position of Moses. Commanded by God to speak to the pharaoh, but uncertain that I can communicate that message in a way that will be understood. Who will speak for me? Who will make comprehensible to others something I do not understand about myself?

Knowing Percy is Catholic, I think he is working toward something like this: that the key to living well and understanding yourself within the cosmos is in relation to the God to who created it, and you. But the problem of The Fall is not just that it divorces us from God. It divorces us from ourselves, and because we can hardly understand ourselves, we are ultimately divorced from others as well. There is no mere set of symbols that we can flash to those around us to make our interior life intelligible to the other.

Percy is probably not going to go this far, but this is what I love about the idea of the communion of saints. Not just the officially canonized saints, but all of my redeemed ancestors in heaven are past the effects of the Fall. They can know and love me in a way no living person (not even myself) can.
