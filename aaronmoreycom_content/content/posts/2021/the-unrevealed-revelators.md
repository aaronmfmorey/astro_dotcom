I was struck recently by the realization that Gillian Welch and David Rawlings appear to have zero public persona.
I've never heard about spouses, exes or kids. I've never seen them take a public stand on a political issue. I've never
even seen a picture of one of them wearing a Dodgers hat going to get coffee. Neither of them have a "Personal Life"
section on their Wikipedia pages.

I find this remarkable. I'd be equally unsurprised to learn that they've been quietly married for 15 years, or that
they're absolute ascetics. In either case, it seems they've lived for decades with a complete purity of intention: to
go on stage, play flawless heartrending folk music, and disappear immediately after. The ultimate craftsmen.

_After writing this, I did some googling and learned a couple of things, but I'm going to be cool about it and pretend
I didn't._
