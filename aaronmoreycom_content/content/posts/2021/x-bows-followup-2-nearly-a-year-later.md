I've been using the X-Bows Nature I [wrote about](/posts/2020/x-bows-natural-a-review/) last summer for almost a year now. My fingers have adjusted to the layout, and my typing is as fast or faster than it's ever been.

I have just one complaint: the keycaps aren't holding up well. So far only the most used keys are showing wear: the Command Key and the space bar. But I imagine it's just a matter of time for the others.

This is especially obnoxious because the X-Bows keys are non-standard sizes. You can't just go to Amazon or NewEgg and buy a new set. The X-Bows website doesn't even seem to sell keycaps separately from the keyboards, so there's no clear way to replace the caps outside of buying a new keyboard.

It's still the best ergonomic keyboard I've ever used, but that remains a relatively low bar with definite room remaining for improvement.
