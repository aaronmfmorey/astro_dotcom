> A man awaited me there—not the one I sought—but one who understood Whom it was I had come for, and knew as well as I that His capture was beyond any thief's power. I knelt, and there,…I destroyed the Dream-Master as He has been sacrificed so often, devouring His white, wheaten flesh that we might all possess life without end.

> — Gene Wolfe, _The Detective of Dreams_

I had barely taken a breath from learning that Notre Dame has been (as much as possible) saved, when I leaned that Gene Wolfe died. I was probably already vulnerable but this was a real and surprisingly strong grief. I shouldn't have been surprised, Wolfe was 87 and had been in poor health for a number of years. It's hard to say sci-fi stories are on scale with the grandeur of Notre Dame, but it does feel like a real loss to Catholic art.
