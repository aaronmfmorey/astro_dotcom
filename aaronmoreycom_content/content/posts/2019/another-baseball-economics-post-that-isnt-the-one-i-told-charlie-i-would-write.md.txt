If you've been following this blog a while \[_ed.: no one has_\], you'll know I take an interest in the economics of baseball. I wrote a bit about minor league and pre-arbitration salaries [here](https://onhishead.wordpress.com/2018/09/23/big-league-avarice/). You can review that post to get a taste of how salaries are structured for younger players.

That has a couple of follow-up consequences:

1. Because younger players are paid a fraction (often 10% or less) of what similarly talented players with more service time can command, they are much more valuable to teams as commodities\*. Why hope a 29-year-old (middle-aged by baseball standards) can continue to perform at his usual rate for the 3 years and $50M contract he is nominally worth on the open market, when you have three minor leaguers in your system who are likely to give you 80% of his performance for $500k, with no guaranteed contracts (you can demote or cut them if they don't perform, without being on the hook for their salary)? You can see how the owners are, in this sense, behaving rationally. So free agents are either not getting signed at all, or are taking massively reduced contracts by comparison to their supposed value.
2. Players and agents aren't dumb, they see this happening. Rather than test out free agency, players are signing extensions: fully guaranteed contracts with their current teams, usually at a steep (50-80%) discount compared to their presumptive market value. You can see how the individual players are behaving rationally here. But it's bad news for the players' union. Players as a whole are taking home an increasingly smaller cut of the profits from the sport.

Why, if both players and owners are behaving rationally, is one side benefitting so disproportionately to the other?

The answer is, from a game theory perspective, the sides are playing different games. The players, it probably seems obvious, are playing baseball. If the minimum wage was $50k rather than $500k, they would probably still do it. The money is important (no one wants to feel underpaid) but secondary to what they're actually doing. As everyone's favorite pair of walking forearms, Randal Grichuk, [said](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-behind-mlbs-bizarre-spike-in-contract-extensions/): "The way I looked at it was taking guaranteed money, setting my family up for life, it’s hard to turn down…He \[Ronald Acuña, a player who signed an extension that was seen as underwhelming even the lowered standards of extension discounts\] could have probably waited and got more, but it’s tough to talk negatively about a guy who just got $100 million and is set for life…_What’s the difference between $100 \[million\] and $200 \[million\]_?" \[Emphasis mine\]

The owners on the other hand are, by the fact that they can buy a $1B business, self-selected as a group of people who are already rich. If they were merely concerned with setting up themselves and their families to be comfortable for the foreseeable future, they would have retired as millionaires to a Caribbean island. Instead, they are, like the players, among the best of the best at playing the game no one ever calls by its real name: "get even more money."

It's no surprise that, when two different groups of people are playing overlapping games with separate rules and incentives, they get vastly different outcomes.

(\* Let me stipulate here that thinking of people as commodities is kind of dehumanizing if you take it too far, but that is in fact the way professional sports work so I'm going to use the terminology for the way the teams view players.)
