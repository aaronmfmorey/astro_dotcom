Although I haven't been able to find a first-person account of Endo saying so, it's widely understood that Endō felt _Silence_ had failed to effectively communicate  the message he intended. However, in this post I would like to defend Endo's work, if only against the author himself. While Rodrigues's intentions are depicted as good and his will compromised by torture, his capitulation is nonetheless a clear moral failure—and this can be seen from any of the three viewpoints a reader might interpret the book from.

First, the purely pragmatic viewpoint. A secular reader might think the message from "Christ" telling him to step on the _fumie_ was good advice. Don't make other people suffer simply so you can maintain your personal purity! The greater good is to end the Japanese captives' torture. This sounds good, but it's ultimately short-sighted. Upon his apostasy, the handful of Japanese Christians are freed, but Rodrigues has given up entire ministry to all the Japanese Christians. Instead, he's used by the government to persecute Christians for decades. In exchange for a small number of prisoners, he spends the rest of his life arresting others.[^1]

Secondly, from the orthodox Christian point of view, Rodrigues fails to recognize that to apostatize is to give up the eternal good in exchange for earthly comfort. As Cardinal Newman [wrote](http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume1/lecture8.html):

> She \[the Church\] holds that, unless  she can, in her own way, do good to souls, it is no use her doing anything; she holds that it were better for sun and moon to drop from heaven, for the earth to fail, and for all the many millions who are upon it to die of starvation in extremest agony, so far as temporal affliction goes, than that one soul, I will not say, should be lost, but should commit one single venial sin, should tell one wilful untruth, though it harmed no one, or steal one poor farthing without excuse.

Quite simply, from the Christian perspective there is no such thing as sinning for the greater good.

Finally, and I think this point has been missed by most commentators who have written about _Silence_, Rodrigues fails specifically as a Jesuit. The spirituality of the Jesuit order is based around the principles in St. Ignatius's _Spiritual_ _Exercises,_ a day-by-day guide for a forty day spiritual retreat. In the _Exercises_, Ignatius leads the retreatant through rules for discernment of God's will. Ignatius, the old soldier, recognizes the spiritual life as a battlefield. God and His angels are battling against the Devil for dominance within each person's soul. Ignatius calls these forces the Good Spirit and the Evil Spirit, and notes how each acts differently depending on the disposition of the soul they are working in. The Evil Spirit can do great damage when the soul is in desolation. That is, "I call desolation all the contrary of \[consolation\] such as darkness of soul, disturbance in it, movement to things low and earthly, the unquiet of different agitations and temptations, moving to want of confidence, without hope, without love, when one finds oneself all lazy, tepid, sad, and as if separated from his Creator and Lord."

In the moments before his apostasy, Rodrigues is certainly in a state of desolation. As all Jesuits are taught, Ignatius has a rule for how to act in desolation:

> In time of desolation never to make a change; but to be firm and constant in the resolutions and determination in which one was the day preceding such desolation, or in the determination in which he was in the preceding consolation. Because, as in consolation it is rather the good spirit who guides and counsels us, so _in desolation it is the bad, with whose counsels we cannot take a course to decide rightly._

It is in the depths of this desolation that Ferriera comes to Rodrigues to tempt him. (Surely his time as a Jesuit formator taught him that is when a soul is most vulnerable!) When Rodrigues nears the point of giving in and stepping on the _fumie_, he hears a voice that seems to be Christ telling him "Trample! Trample! I more than anyone know the pain in your foot. Trample! It was to be trampled by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men's pain I carried my cross." In this time of desolation, Rodrigues should know not to follow the promptings of this spirit, that voice that tries to lead him away from the willingness to suffer he had in times of consolation.

Like the temptations the devil offered Christ in the desert, the offer is not entirely a lie. But for each of the temptations offered to him, Jesus didn't try to argue the point or reason with the Evil One. Rather, he remembered God's command and stuck stubbornly to it: "It is written, Not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God." The spirit speaking to Rodrigues is right, Christ did come to the world to be trampled and share in humanity's suffering — "But woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed."

[^1]: This utilitarian logic is complicated further if you take the interpretation [Capn. Peadbody puts forth.](http://captpeabody.blogspot.com/2017/04/silence-exercise-in-film-criticism-and.html) This is the best piece of criticism I've seen for _Silence_, and if I hadn't already had this post drafted, I probably would have just let him speak for me.
