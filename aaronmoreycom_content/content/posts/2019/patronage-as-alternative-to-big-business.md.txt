I follow a [Cardinals blog](https://www.vivaelbirdos.com/) that runs on a publishing platform whose parent company is none other than Vox, the kings of worst-of-both-worlds technocratic Liberalism. They've been on the platform for a several years, and in that time there's been the occasional push to publish more ad-posts or write on a corporate-mandated schedule to drive clicks. But for the most part, the site managers have held Vox at an arms-length and more or less kept the site on-mission. Unfortunately, it finally seems to have become too popular for the overlords to ignore. They've decided to strip-mine it for ad revenue and leave it for dead.

There's been discussion about how to re-form the community elsewhere, but the sad fact is the platform has largely succeeded because it's technologically very well-built. Another venue won't offer the same features that make community discussion so easy-to-use. (It might not seem obvious, but an important aspect of good discussion is that it be easy to do. Every little hassle with reading or posting comments causes users to try less. If it's a pain to read all the responses to your comment, you're more likely to just flame the other guy, rather than reading and responding thoughtfully.) Someone suggested that nested comments, key shortcuts, upvotes, etc couldn't possibly be that hard to code. And they're right, an experienced web developer could probably start from an open source platform like Wordpress and build out an "80% good enough" alternative over a couple of weeks.

Ignoring, for the time being, the cost of a developer's time (probably $50-100/hour itself), the code alone won't get the job done. After that, you need hosting, bandwidth, image storage, a database powerful enough to handle hundreds of concurrent requests, a support staff to fix bugs, etc., etc., et cetera! That's all doable, but the price is more than I, or most amateur baseball enthusiasts, could afford.

What are your options then?

1. Sell ads. Well, that's what got us here in the first place. We're two decades into the era of "post writing for free on the internet and hope a business model develops before we go broke." The only workable business model has, again and again, been proven to be spammy ads, popups and selling the users' personal data to the Yakuza.
2. Subscription service. Have users pay a fee to access some or all of the content the site creates. It _can_ work. The Athletic runs on that model (although I'm not sure they've reported whether they're profitable or not at this point). But notice there's only one Athletic, and it covers all sports and regions under one site. You'd be hard pressed to find enough subscribers to cover the cost of a relatively niche specialty like "St. Louis Cardinal fans who are into sabermetrics." Another note: The Athletic has succeeded by sucking up all the best writers from local papers and news outlets. Local newspapers have tried the subscription model with limited success at best.
3. Patronage! In this model, we admit that curating good writing is inevitably a labor of love, rather than profit motive. The French kings didn't spend great sums of wealth building Notre Dame in order to get a monetary ROI. (There's a _le roi_ pun in here somewhere but my French vocabulary is not up to the challenge.\*) Their motives don't even have to be entirely pure: sure, the kings wanted to honor Jesus and His Mother, but they also wanted to show off their wealth, build Paris's prestige, give the people something nice to increase the regime's popularity, etc. A wealthy patron could do the same: pony up the money required to keep a site running, just for the joy and prestige of having such thing exist. This isn't too far-fetched: Fangraphs runs largely on this model. While it does have some advertising and an option to join a paid user tier, all the content is free and the lights are mainly kept on by their founder's personal money (I believe he was an early employee of AOL). A caveat: there's a fine line between having a patron and being owned as an advertising/PR asset. You might think Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt would be a natural patron for such a site, but being owned by the team owner would surely bring in conflicts of interest that would not likely be settled in the site's favor.

So there we have it. I've solved the decades-old problem of making internet writing profitable: don't even bother!
