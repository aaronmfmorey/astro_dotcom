In the 7th section of the Rule, St. Benedict writes about humility. He says that there are 12 stages of humility, progressing from the first degree (fear of God: the awareness that God sees us at all times and knows our sins) running to the twelfth (living each moment as if standing before your Final Judgement).

For Benedict, humility is not—as we often tend to think—a kind of modesty about your accomplishments or a consideration of yourself as no better than others. In fact, he hardly mentions humility as a relationship to others at all. Sure, you should live in obedience to those over you, and avoid tempting your peers to sin. But for Benedict humility is a recognition of your proper relationship toward God. And that relationship, when you understand it rightly, is infinitely unequal. You can only relate to God with full acknowledgement of your sinfulness, and beg Him for mercy. Like every aspect of monastic life, humility is directed primarily toward perfecting the soul for the next life, and only secondarily toward any earthly good.
