"Santino's got _a little friend_."

I knew from the tone, this mook wasn't talking about Peter Dinklage. Whoever the muscle was, if Santino Collazzo sent him personally, I was in it deep. Like fish-in-a-flack-jacket deep.

"Tell Santino if he's coming for me, he knows where I work. Leave my — hey that's enough, I said I'd be back in a minute! — Tell him leave my family out of this. I got a tree to finish decorating."

I shut the door in his face. Even in this business you gotta take a weekend off sometimes, just to keep the missus off your back if nothing else.

A few minutes later, banging on the back door. I ignored it. We got Lou Monte on, we got the wine out, Maria's stringing popcorn. Business can wait.

The banging didn't stop. _Cavolo, there aren't kidding around tonight_. I went out to the back door, no one in sight. One step into the alley and I see a business card.

_It's come to this, Santino really brought in Dominick._

They say you never see him kick but you do, trust me. You see it for what feels like an entire lifetime. And in a way it is, it's all there is that's left to see.
