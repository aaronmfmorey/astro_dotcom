I noticed an interesting pattern in my son’s speech: When a word starts with a letter he has difficulty pronouncing,
he pronounces it as the following consonant grouping.

For example, he isn’t yet able to say the the letter “f.” When he says “fruiT”, he pronounces it “Troot” (well, more
like “twoot” but I’m ignoring the rhotacism here).

The same goes for G. “grandMa” (shortened to be more like “Gramma”) becomes “Mramma”. But “graPes” becomes “Prapes”.

Is there a term or an explanation for this phenomenon?
