At dusk in Rome, in the middle of a driving rain, an old man trudged alone through St. Peter’s Square. Disease, and fear of disease, had emptied the streets. He continued on because he had set his mind to a task only he could carry out. The people, huddled indoors and afraid, couldn’t do it for themselves. He was going to heal them of their sins.

In a time when the laity have been cut off from the sacraments, it’s an opportunity to remember that the efficacy of the sacraments doesn’t come from our own power. We aren’t, strictly speaking, necessary. Rather, the Church offers them for us regardless of our individual disposition. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about Waugh’s description of the Low Mass:

> Of the extraneous attractions of the Church which most drew me was the spectacle of the priest and his server at low Mass, stumping up to the altar without a glance to discover how many or how few he had in his congregation; a craftsman and his apprentice; a man with a job which he alone was qualified to do

Of course it’s good for a person that they take part in the sacraments to the extent they are able, but the mass continues on regardless. All across the world, secular priests have been united with cloistered religious, celebrating the mass in private for the sake of those who will never see or know about it. The Body, Blood, Soul and Divinty of Jesus is continually brought down to earth, the Office is continually prayed. Grace pours down on the earth, completely outside our vision.

This hidden work points to an even more invisible reality: the constant worship and intercession offered by the saints and angels. While your priest might be visible through a webcam or a parked car, these completely unseen forces offer endless perfect prayer in the direct presence of God. Every ancestor in heaven and all the countless angels are taking part in the web of grace that is His plan of salvation. Offer your suffering in this time along with them, so one day we all will be together when “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more. Nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more, for the former things are passed away.”

Please pray for me and my family, and I will pray for each of my readers.

> Noctem quiétam et finem perféctum concédat nobis Dóminus omnípotens. Amen.
