The "armored cars and tanks and guns" line from _The Men Behind The Wire_ is surely an allusion to "guns and drums and 
drums and guns" from _Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye._ I can't believe I never picked up on that before.

Wikipedia mentions that _Zombie_ also references that line, which is another big duh in retrospect.
