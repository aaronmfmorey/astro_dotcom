# Prologue

Captain Ahab had the white whale, and I have the ergonomic mechanical keyboard.

I'm a programmer by trade, so I spend 8 or more hours with my hands on a keyboard basically every day of my life. By the
time I graduated college, I was starting to notice the strain on my hands and wrists, and I quickly decided to invest
in a split style ergonomic keyboard.

My first was the Microsoft Natural Elite. As far as modern(ish) ergo keyboards go, it's best of the bunch. But you'll 
note a few deficiencies here:

- The directional keys are weirdly shaped, not the traditional Up, then Left/Down/Right. They're also about half the 
  size of a standard key, which makes it easier to mistype them.
- The Delete/Insert/Page Up/Page Down/Home/End keys are in an unusual 2x3 vertical pattern instead of the usual 3x2 
  horizontal. Again they're quite a bit smaller than the rest of the keys
- The F keys are also smaller and fairly easy to mis-type
- The key switches use rubber domes: they're less clicky and more mushy when you press them down. The Natural Elite had 
  the best domes of any I've used but the frustration remains.

But the biggest drawback of all: Microsoft inexplicably stopped producing one of their most popular keyboards of all 
time, and prices on the second hand market went through the roof.

I experimented with the Microsoft Natural 4000 (the perfect layout but one of the most atrociously constructed 
keyboards I've ever used. You have to pound the keys to get them to register, leaving your hands exhausted and your 
neighbors irritated by the racket), and a bunch of others before ultimately settling with the Microsoft Sculpt (yes, 
Microsoft is basically the only mainstream peripheral manufacturer who seems to have put any effort into creating 
affordable ergonomic keyboards).

The Sculpt was a compromise choice from the beginning. It uses scissor switches, which are a big step up from rubber 
domes but not quite as satisfying as mechanical switches. It also lacked a numpad (you could pay extra for the model 
that had a free-floating numpad that connected through a combination of Bluetooth and wishing on a star) and had a 
weird squashed-together arrangement of the arrow keys and Home/End/Page Up/Page Down. The strangest feature might be 
location of the vestigial appendix of the keyboard world, the Insert key: dropped basically into the middle of nowhere 
where you can hit it by accident when going for any of four other keys.

I used Sculpts for a 6-7 years (I had one at home and went through two more at work). But that didn't stop me from 
periodically googling "mechanical ergonomic keyboard" and dreaming.

The results were always the same: something crazy and expensive like the [Kinesis Advantage](https://i.imgur.com/Cq9nI1I.jpg), or something 
[missing half the keys](https://www.ponoko.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Ergonomic-Mechanical-Keyboard-6-Profet-Colorful-Atreus-1024x512.png), or [just a regular keyboard that breaks in half in the middle](https://www.keychatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/keychatter_2015-03-04_01-38-05-679x350.png), or Kickstarter 
vaporware. No one seemed to be doing the obvious thing: recreating the Microsoft Natural 4000, but with mechanical 
key switches instead of mushy rubber domes.

That is, until the X-Bows Knight Plus came along. It's a mechanical keyboard with the keys (mostly) in the right places, and an 
attached numpad. It's also $259, so I adjusted my expectations down accordingly. I eventually bit the bullet and bought 
the X-Bows Nature. It's essentially the same keyboard, minus the numpad and made of plastic rather than aluminum. But 
at half the price, you can't complain too much.

# Good Grief Is This The Review Yet?

Yes.

The keyboard shipped from somewhere that seemed to be in China, but since I don't read Chinese I wasn't able to use the 
the tracking website. I won't lie, I half-suspected I had been scammed.

In spite of my worries (and various happenings in the wider world, which I don't need to harp on here), the keyboard 
came in a few days earlier than was expected. I think it was supposed to arrive within 10 business days but ended up 
coming in seven.

Right away, the packaging was a winner.

The box was a solid-feeling cardboard, and the design looks pretty spiffy.

Inside, the packaging seemed decently protective and there was a little card to help newbies figure out how to type on 
a split keyboard. The back has a helpful guide to the function keys that open media, adjust backlighting, change 
between programmable mappings, etc. It also includes a couple of extra switches and tools to remove the keycaps and 
switches. I didn't get a picture of the other side or the tools.

Right out of the box, you'll note that it looks exceedingly cool. The default backlighting style flickers along with 
your keypresses. I've kept it because I'm a Mountain Dew-swilling dork at heart, but I'll probably turn it off when 
(if?) we ever go back to working in the office.

One thing that warmed my cranky old-fogey heart is the presence of a USB cord. I'm fed up to death with peripherals 
that want to connect over Bluetooth or their own proprietary wireless dongle. Why anyone would rather pour battery 
after battery into a device that can be interrupted by a faulty microwave in the break room, rather than just plug the 
doggone thing in, is beyond me. You're not walking around that house with that keyboard are you? If you're anything 
like me, your keyboard is never more than a couple of feet from your computer.

## How's That Layout?

One thing I kept seeing on reviews was people talking about the adjustment period to get used to the key layout. They 
generally seemed to be coming from regular keyboards so I wasn't expecting myself to need much adjustment. Wrong! I was 
typing at about 1/3 my normal speed at first.

![](/assets/images/img_2503.jpg)

Even for an ergonomic user, it's a big change. First of all, this being a mechanical keyboard, the switches and keycaps 
need to be interchangeable. That means they have to all (or all the letters, numbers and characters anyway) be the same 
size. You'll notice in the pictures of other keyboards above, the keys are varying sizes to prevent empty space between 
keys. X-Bows is not afraid of empty space. Early on, I frequently hit the sides of or squarely between two keys.

Second, the delete and backspace keys aren't all that close to where your hands are accustomed to finding them. Half of 
the speed I lost, I think, was mistyping the equal sign when I was trying to hit the backspace or delete to fix another 
one of my errors. Fortunately, they're pretty big so once your hands adjust it's hard to miss.

To help reduce total hand movement, the designers placed a backspace and an enter key in the middle of the keyboard. 
I'm not sure it was worth the effort. Half the time I was reaching for the B, I hit the Enter key instead. This is 
annoying enough under any circumstances but embarrassing when you're trying to quickly explain something over chat and 
you keep submitting the whole message every time you mean to type a B. I ended up removing the keycap because I just 
couldn't stop accidentally hitting enter. I'll need to get some extra keycaps to cover that gap up eventually. The 
backspace key is less obtrusive but my hands don't have the muscle memory to go to the middle of the keyboard to 
delete text, and I'm not sure it will develop without significant effort.

The lack of a numpad makes me sad, but numpads are cheap. I'll probably just invest in a mechanical one that costs 
like $40. _(Edit: It cost under $20)_

All that said, I'm back up to what my typing speed has always been (upper 60s to mid 70s). I think I'm probably not a 
great typist in general, and this keyboard has definitely exposed some of my flaws.

## Click Click

On the plus side, the keys feel great. X-Bows gives you a wide selection of Gateron (Cherry imitation) switches. I
won't go through them all here, but it's every color I'm familiar with as well as an option to upgrade to the "Silent" 
version of any of them.

I went with Silent Browns. If I never had to worry about working around people, I probably would have gone with Blues, 
but such is life. My wife, who works directly across the table from me, confirmed that this keyboard is quieter than 
the rubber dome ergonomic I had been using, since I don't have to pound the keys. Instead, they activate with a very 
graceful, satisfying click. I just want to get to my editor and start typing when I log in in the morning, because 
they're such a joy to type on. Some people apparently believe Gaterons are a bit less crisp than real Cherrys but I 
don't notice any difference (based on only a little experience with Cherry). The switches pop right out of the board 
with the included tool, so you could easily replace them if you felt like investing the money in doing so. I don't see 
the need.

# The Bottom Line

I like the X-Bows Nature a lot. It's still not perfect, but it's the best combination of (basically) standard ergonomic 
split key layout with mechanical switches that I know of on the market. If that appeals to you, you'll find it worth your while to pay only a bit more than a Sculpt to get the real deal.

# Disclaimer:
I was not paid for this review in any way: money, swag, barter, favors, kickbacks, Bitcoins, etc. This is not for lack 
of interest. I would happily accept any remuneration X-Bows, Microsoft, Old Forester, or any other wealthy corporation 
would like to offer. I wouldn't even have to lie, I believe getting free stuff from you would genuinely increase my 
feelings of favorability toward your products. Just something to keep in mind. (Hit me up, [Baronius Press](https://www.baroniuspress.com/book.php?wid=56&bid=59#tab=tab-1), I'm an influencer).
