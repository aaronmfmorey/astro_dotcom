_I'm using [Leah Libresco-Sargeant's Tiny Book Club](https://tinybookclub.substack.com/p/our-august-read-contrapuntal-order?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&utm_source=copy) as an excuse to dust off the blog and get writing again. This 
is my first month (maybe the first month overall?) so I don't know exactly what the process is going to look like, but 
today I'm riffing on the article she shared: [Contrapuntal Order](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/04/contrapuntal-order) by John Ahern._

At the risk of over-simplifying, Ahern's thesis seems to be that harmony in music requires different parts of the song 
to work in different ways, sometimes one subordinate to another, but all of the parts leading together to a unified 
whole none of the individuals could achieve on their own. He then relates this to the relations between persons, 
particularly in marriage.

I'm going to go even further, and suggest this structure is built into the Creation itself. The first thing I thought 
of when reading this was the opening chapter of _The Silmarillion_. The Uncreated Creator Eru Ilúvatar explains to the 
Ainur, his heavenly court, his plan for the unfolding of creation:

> Of the theme that I have declared to you, I will now that ye make in harmony together a Great Music. And since I have 
> kindled you with the Flame Imperishable, ye shall show forth your powers in adorning this theme, each with his own 
> thoughts and devices, if he will. But I will sit and hearken, and be glad that through you great beauty has been 
> wakened into song.
> 
> _&mdash; The Music of the Ainur_

Out of this song, all of the world is planned to come into being. As Tolkien explains later, each of the Ainur has a 
special area of interest: the earth, water, the elements, plant, animals, etc. that they are particularly responsible 
for and presumably "sing into being" as part of the Great Music.

Shortly, Melkor, one of the Ainur becomes obsessed with his own prominence and glory, and begins to sing in discord 
with the rest of the Music. This goes on for some time, and the singers worry that the Great Music will be ruined. But 
the Creator intervenes:

> Then Ilúvatar arose, and the Ainur perceived that he smiled, and he lifted up his left hand, and a new theme began 
> amid the storm, like and yet unlike the former theme, and it gathered power and had new beauty.
> 
> _&mdash; The Music of the Ainur_

Each time Melkor tries to sing in discord, Ilúvatar works it back into the harmony again and again:

> And it seemed at last there were two musics progressing at one time before the seat of Ilúvatar, and they were 
> utterly at variance. the one was deep and wide and beautiful....The other...was loud, and vain, and endlessly 
> repeated; and it had little harmony...but it seemed that its most triumphant notes were taken by the other woven 
> into its own solemn pattern....
> 
> The Ilúvatar spoke...'No theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in 
> my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, 
> which he himself hath not imagined'
> 
> _&mdash; The Music of the Ainur_

I am not a musically gifted person, but reading this as a teenager was the first time I understood that God's Providence 
isn't a matter of happy coincidence, or some kind of algorithmic pre-planning. When we read that "that in all things 
God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose," it's not a simple-minded 
encouragement that things will just so happen to work out, like Mr. Magoo stumbling through a construction site and 
through sheer luck being lifted out of the danger by a rogue crane hook.

It's certainly not a promise that you won't suffer ill-fate: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and 
take up their cross and follow me." Rather God Himself is directing all of creation in such a way that even the 
disasters and tragedies of the world are incorporated into His plan and will bring about the goodness He wants 
regardless.

God is so dedicated to this plan that He came into creation to take part in it: "he emptied himself, taking the form of 
a slave, coming in human likeness; and found human in appearance, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even 
death on a cross". Or, to put it Thomistically:

> "As Augustine says (Enchiridion xi): "Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His 
> works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil." This is part of the infinite 
> goodness of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good."
> 
> [Summa Thelogiae 1 Q2 a3](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3)

God foresaw that the sin of man would lead them to reject and even kill their Creator, but that didn't deter Him. 
Instead, He used the death of God and the ultimate sin of the creature to bring about the destruction of sin and death 
themselves. If we are united with God we will not escape danger or suffering. Instead we will enter into it and be 
purified by it: "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me." If God 
willingly suffered and died so that He could bring a greater good out of it, how can we say we're imitating Him if we 
won't submit to the same?
