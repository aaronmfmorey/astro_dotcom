I just finished reading H.P. Lovecraft's _Shadow Over Innsmouth_, and I was struck by the idea that it may have inspired parts of Gene Wolfe's _The Fifth Head of Cerberus._

Spoilers for both from here forward.

In _Shadow,_ the main character is revealed to be a member of the Marsh family (this, along with "Gilman", seem to be Lovecraft punning on the fish creatures' watery origin). Likewise, the explorer in _Fifth Head_'s _VRT_ is named "Marsch." Both encounter strange otherworldly beings. Both find themselves losing their human identity and being replaced by the creature.

Wolfe clearly was familiar with Lovecraft and not afraid to write Cthulu mythos into his own work (see _An Evil Guest_). I think a re-read of _Fifth Head of Cerberus_ with this in mind would be fruitful.
