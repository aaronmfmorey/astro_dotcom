I’m in my mid-thirties and I’ve been serious about Catholicism since I was a teenager. But somehow this only just
occurred to me:

Yes, Jesus suffers for our sins. But not in the sense of “Ouch! Why are you doing this to me?!” Rather, he suffers with
us. I’m hurting myself (whether I actively feel or recognize it) and He loves me too much to be unmoved.

> O sweetest Jesus, whose overflowing charity towards men is most ungratefully repaid by such great forgetfulness,
> neglect and contempt, see, prostrate before Thy altars, we strive by special honor to make amends for the wicked
> coldness of men and the contumely with which Thy most loving Heart is everywhere treated. At the same time, mindful
> of the fact that we too have sometimes not been free from unworthiness, and moved therefore with most vehement
> sorrow, in the first place we implore Thy mercy on us, being prepared by voluntary expiation to make amends for the
> sins we have ourselves committed, and also for the sins of those who wander far from the way of salvation, whether
> because, being obstinate in their unbelief, they refuse to follow Thee as their shepherd and leader, or because,
> spurning the promises of their Baptism, they have cast off the most sweet yoke of Thy law. We now endeavor to expiate
> all these lamentable crimes together, and it is also our purpose to make amends for each one of them severally: for
> the want of modesty in life and dress, for impurities, for so many snares set for the minds of the innocent, for the
> violation of feast days, for the horrid blasphemies against Thee and Thy saints, for the insults offered to Thy Vicar
> and to the priestly order, for the neglect of the Sacrament of Divine love or its profanation by horrible sacrileges,
> and lastly for the public sins of nations which resist the rights and the teaching authority of the Church which Thou
> hast instituted. Would that we could wash away these crimes with our own blood! And now, to make amends for the
> outrage offered to the Divine honor, we offer to Thee the same satisfaction which Thou didst once offer to Thy Father
> on the Cross and which Thou dost continually renew on our altars, we offer this conjoined with the expiations of the
> Virgin Mother and of all the Saints, and of all pious Christians, promising from our heart that so far as in us lies,
> with the help of Thy grace, we will make amends for our own past sins, and for the sins of others, and for the neglect
> of Thy boundless love, by firm faith, by a pure way of life, and by a perfect observance of the Gospel law, especially
> that of charity; we will also strive with all our strength to prevent injuries being offered to Thee, and gather as
> many as we can to become Thy followers. Receive, we beseech Thee, O most benign Jesus, by the intercession of the
? Blessed Virgin Mary, the Reparatress, the voluntary homage of this expiation, and vouchsafe, by that great gift of
> final perseverance, to keep us most faithful until death in our duty and in Thy service, so that at length we may all
> come to that fatherland, where Thou with the Father and the Holy Ghost livest and reignest God for ever and ever.
>
> Amen.
