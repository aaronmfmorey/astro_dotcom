I recently read Gene Wolfe’s novella _The Death of Dr. Island_ and listened to the excellent 
[Gene Wolfe Literary Podcast series](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-gene-wolfe-literary-podcast/id1305307750?i=1000455354272) about it. They covered the story quite thoroughly, except for one nagging 
question that I don’t think I have an answer to.

I’m sorry to make this a homework post, but you’ll really want to read the novella (available, among other places, on 
Kindle in _The Best of Gene Wolfe_ collection) and listen to the podcast. Spoilers galore from here forward.

<hr/>

I left the podcast series with a sense of satisfaction. My gut reaction to the story has been essentially accurate, 
although I had not caught all of the references they were able to point out. But they glossed over one detail that, in 
my opinion, changes the tone of the story, depending on how you interpret it. What was Nicholas/Kenneth’s ultimate fate?

Nicholas says he had a vision once, of his own dead body, black and floating aimlessly in the void of space. Surely 
Wolfe wasn’t intending this arresting imagery as a throwaway bit of detail. It must be a foreshadowing of something.

I think we’re meant to take it that Nicholas’s attempt to destroy Dr. Island at the end of the novel isn’t his last. 
Ultimately he destroys the very world that is sustaining his life.

Without even very well understanding the physics of the place or the extent of his powers, Nicholas was able to do 
enough damage to make Dr. Island summon the “gods” to stop him. Given more time on the island, surely he could figure 
out how to commit the mayhem he was initially stopped from. He always has before! That’s how he ended up there in the 
first place. Particularly given that his desire for destruction isn’t ruled mainly by his emotions, but by his ability 
to act out his deep seated anger even when he wasn’t presently feeling it.

The tone of the story will change depending on how this destruction is accomplished. Is he a newer, eviler Ignacio, 
acting out of malevolence and seeking bigger and bigger thrills than the small goldfish being fed to him can give? Or 
is it an act of self-sacrifice? Does he take pity on future patients and destroy Dr. Island to prevent more of them 
from being tormented?

I think Wolfe is playing a trick on us with the line “this was the death I chose for her. You could call it the death 
of Dr. Island, a death that would help someone else.” Ultimately the story isn’t just about one particular death 
_caused by_ Dr. Island. It’s tone, of nihilism or redemption, will come down to what kind of death is visited upon Dr. 
Island himself.
