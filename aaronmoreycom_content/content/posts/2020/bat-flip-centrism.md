The biggest argument among baseball fans circa 2012 was bat flips: are they cool? Do they show up the other team?
Should you "act like you've been there before"?

The answer, at least online, has been settled for years. The "pro" side won decisively. No one who wants to be taken
seriously complains about them out loud. Unfortunately, for people who formed their fandom in that era, it's become
engrained as a signifier that you're one of the Cool Fans, and not like those Old Guys.

The fact is, bat flips are simply fine. They're not more offensive than a fist pump or a celebratory scream or just
putting your head down and running. But by the same token, they're not more exciting than a fist pump or a scream, or
nothing at all. Insisting on how great bat flips are is about as fresh as logging onto Reddit and posting about how
epic bacon is.

Players can and should celebrate as they see fit, but if you can't get into an exciting play unless the player does a
sufficient celebratory move, it may not be baseball that you like.
