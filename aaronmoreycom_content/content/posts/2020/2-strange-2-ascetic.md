> If I had been a Heathen,
>
> Iâ€™d have wrapped my toga tight,
>
> And orated to the Senate
>
> In my gleaming gold and white
>
> But Higgins is a Heathen,
>
> And he logs onto the Zoom,
>
> With a golf shirt for the camera
>
> And below Fruit of the Loom

_With apologies to [G. K. Chesterton](https://www.chesterton.org/the-song-of-the-strange-ascetic/)_
