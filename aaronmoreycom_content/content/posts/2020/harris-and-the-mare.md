I noticed recently that, good song though it may be, Stan Rogers's _Harris and the Mare_ doesn't make any sense 
logistically.

Have a listen [here](https://youtu.be/Sw2Me2pPQuY) if you haven't before.

To summarize: the framing device is a man relaying the story of his traumatic evening to a friend, Harris. He and his 
wife went out to, presumably, the local pub for a drink. There are "neighbors in the room" and he recognizes the 
drunken brute as "Young Clary." But after the fight he carries his wife "half a mile", just to get to a friend's house 
to ask for a ride home? Why not just go home directly? How had they gotten to the bar that evening? Did they walk a 
mile or more just for a beer?

Now maybe Stan Rogers didn't think this all through when he wrote the song. Or maybe there's something unstated he's 
leaving for us to fill in ourselves. My guess? Harris is the undertaker.

The wife is "cold as clay" while the man himself was bleeding "from neck to thigh" even before carrying a full-grown 
adult half a mile on foot. Now he "cannot stand." As for the neighbors whom "none of them I'll call a friend no more" 
the implication is not so much an unending grudge as a truncated of opportunity to make amends with them.

The answer to the problem of logistics is that the narrator isn't asking to be returned to his house. He's asking a 
final favor from his only remaining friend: "take us Home."
