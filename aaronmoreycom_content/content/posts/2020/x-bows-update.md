In [my previous post](/posts/2020/x-bows-natural-a-review/) about the X-Bows Nature keyboard, I expressed a couple of 
reservations: a steep learning curve for typing (even if you're accustomed to split ergonomic layouts in general), the 
lack of a numpad and the annoying Enter key in the center if the keyboard.

## Layout Learning Curve

This one resolved itself after a couple of weeks. I'm back into the 70 WPMs on typing tests without russhing or 
straining. My only remaining complaint here is that the starkly different layout makes it annoying to switch back to 
more cramped laptop keyboard layouts. I rarely need to do that anyway so it's fine.

## Numpad

The model with a detachable numpad was another $100+ above the cost of the model I bought. Instead, I bought a $15 
number pad, an $8 set of magnetic latches, and a bottle of gorilla glue. It's not quite as pretty, but it looks 
perfectly fine and gets the job done for a fraction of the cost.

## Enter Key

This one was simpler than I originally realized: rather than remove the keycap and leave an uncovered hole in the 
middle of the keyboard, I removed the switch and put the cap back on. Duh!
