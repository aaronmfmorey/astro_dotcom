I enjoyed this recent [article by Sam Miller](https://pebblehunting.substack.com/p/errors-are-hits-now) 
on MLB official scorers' increasing reluctance to rule plays as errors. 
I especially liked that he included a set of replays at the end to demonstrate 
what official scorers will call hits. I can get behind some of them, and 
some of them seem like they really ought to have been ruled errors.
