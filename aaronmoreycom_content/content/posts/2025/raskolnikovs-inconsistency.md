I'm only about halfway through _Crime and Punishment_ so things may
still come together, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how I'm meant to understand
Raskolnikov's behavior.

Not the murder part, that actually makes sense in its own perverse way. But the 
wild swings in behavior: he's cold then magnanimous then manic, suddenly without 
apparent explanation. When he encounters the drunk girl on the street, he begins 
by flagging down a policeman to protect her from the lecherous passerby, 
but suddenly changes his mind and decides he has no reason to care about her fate.

Or take the scene where when his sister and mother are confronting him in his apartment.
He is scornful of Dunya's decision to marry Luzhin, implying strongly that it would be
akin to prostitution. But when the late Marmeladov's daughter Sonya, an  actual prostitute, 
comes in he suddenly shows her great compassion.

It feels somewhat stilted, as if the character were changing on the author's whim. I've
read [John McWhorter's criticism](https://johnmcwhorter.substack.com/p/pevear-and-volokhonsky-are-indeed)
of Pevear and Volokhonsky's _War and Peace_ ("like every character has aphasia," he said 
recently on _Lexicon Valley_), but I don't detect the same stiltedness in  their _C&P_ 
translation. I don't think my confusion is a translation issue, it seems to me
it's baked into the structure of the story.

It's been a while since I've read _Brothers Karamazov_, but I recall feeling similarly about 
many of the characters there as well. Dostoevsky is concerned with the psychic turmoil of 
the Russian people under the late czarist system. Maybe he's intending to show them casting about for 
who they are and how they should behave: vacillating between idealism and despair in a world
where everyone is constantly teetering on the brink of poverty or political persecution.
