I find it unpleasant and offputting to spend a lot of time in Raskolnikov's mind, but this part here is very relatable:

> he threw himself on the sofa and sat there for a whole hour without moving.... 
> In the end he... realized with delight that it was also possible to lie down on the sofa. 
> Soon a deep, leaden sleep, like a heavy weight came over him.
