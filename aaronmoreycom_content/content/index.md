# Modern Tools, Web 1.0 Attitude
There was a time when the internet was a series of web pages, owned and operated by individuals. Sites were populated 
with miscellany, the things that person happened to be interested in. It wasn’t always cohesive. It wasn’t always even 
interesting!

Technology has advanced; there's no going back. But we can keep the spirit of [Web 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0#Web_1.0) alive.
