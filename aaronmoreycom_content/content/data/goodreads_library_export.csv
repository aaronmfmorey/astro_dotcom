Looking at a stress/unstress pattern chart is all well and good for an initial introduction to a poem. But (at least for me, a learn-by-doing minded person), the FEEL of the pattern only becomes clear when you've read a dozen poems in that meter and you internal monologue starts slipping into it. <br/><br/>I, for example, never got hendecasyllables until I read this collection. When you encounter one example among a collection of poetry, it feels like a mistake. Like a misstep in the rhythm, or a lesser poem that the poet couldn't quite get right. But when you've red 5-10 of them in a row, you can sense the stutter step in the middle that the writer is creating intentionally.<br/><br/>If you're already quite adept at reading poetry this is probably all very basic, but if you're a beginner it really drives itself home.",,,1,0

Not simply that the plot is full of wild action, but that the book itself is written wildly, as if in a manic rush to get it all out. The tone, the pace, the style of prose all careen from one to the next. Humorous, academic, poetic, operatic, maniacal Shakespearean monologs. I admit there were points in the middle where I was waiting for something, for goodness sake to finally happen. But the final chapters come upon you in a rush.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, is the book itself structured like a sea voyage? The jovial early days of preparing to sail and setting off, the tedium of innumerable days at sea, and finally the terror of the mission at hand.<br/><br/>I'll be chewing on this for a long time.",,,1,0

It's deeply imaginative. It has, like any epic should, a strong sense of a larger world going on off the page,  which the narrative of the book reveals only bit by bit. Lots of memorable lines and phrases.<br/><br/>It's not fair, I know, but I just wanted to like it more. It's not on the same level as the best of the best scifi/fantasy epics, like The Lord of the Rings or The Book of the New Sun. The prose is fine, it's not as bad as I was warned it could be, but Herbert not Tolkien or Wolfe. I didn't have the same sense of awed wonder that I expect from this kind of grandly ambitious novel.

Feser spends too much time making snide comments about the purveyors of ""New Atheism"". They mostly deserve it and its often amusing to me to see a good BURN! against an ideological opponent. But by stooping to that level, the book becomes an exercise in preaching to the choir. The people who I'd like to recommend the book to and would be most likely to benefit from it would likely be turned off by the aggressive tone.<br/><br/>I wish Dr. Feser had taken Aquinas's cool-headed tone along with his philosophical framework.",,,1,0
