    After years of maintaining personal sites on either Wordpress or through my own bespoke PHP mini-framework,
    I decided it was time to get serious. Most of what I kept on other sites could have been served as static files,
    why was I going through all the work of maintaining my goofy little framework, or having a dependency on third
    parties like social media or Wordpress? Better just to own and manage my own information through an established web framework.
